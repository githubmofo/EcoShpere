## 20 Reviewers — All Active Simultaneously

```
Tier 1: Always active (universal concerns)
├── precedence-reviewer    → Checks local repo Case Law for past rejections
├── logic-reviewer         → Hallucinated methods, impossible logic, undefined refs
├── security-auditor       → OWASP 2025, injection, JWT, SSRF, IDOR
└── resilience-reviewer    → Swallowed errors, unhandled rejections, missing retries

Tier 2: Code quality
├── dependency-reviewer    → Fabricated packages, supply chain, version compatibility
├── type-safety-reviewer   → 'any' epidemic, Zod parse vs cast, unguarded access
├── complexity-reviewer    → Enforces the Dependency Ladder to prevent over-engineering
├── schema-reviewer        → Missing input validation, loose schemas, raw req.body
└── sql-reviewer           → Injection, N+1, missing indexes, unscoped mutations

Tier 3: Domain-specific
├── frontend-reviewer      → React 19 APIs, RSC violations, hook rules, hydration

## Active Reviewers by Code Type

Not all 19 reviewers produce meaningful findings on all code types. Active reviewers detect their first finding immediately — inactive reviewers auto-pass with "N/A for this code type."

| Code Under Review   | Critical Reviewers                                                |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| REST API route      | logic, security, dependency, type-safety, sql, schema, resilience |
| React component     | logic, frontend, accessibility, type-safety, resilience, ui-ux    |
| Database query      | logic, security, sql, resilience                                  |
| AI LLM integration  | logic, security, ai-code, dependency                              |
| Test file           | test-coverage, logic                                              |
| React Native / Expo | mobile, logic, security, performance, ui-ux                       |
| Next.js page        | logic, frontend, performance, accessibility, ui-ux                       |
| Auth/JWT code       | security, logic, type-safety                                      |

## Verdict Aggregation

```
All 19 verdicts are collected. Aggregated result:

If ANY reviewer = ❌ REJECTED → Global verdict: ❌ REJECTED (must fix before Human Gate)
If any reviewer = ⚠️ WARNING  → Global verdict: ⚠️ WARNINGS (proceed with attention)
If all reviewers = ✅ APPROVED → Global verdict: ✅ APPROVED (proceed to Human Gate)
```

---

## Retry Protocol

When code is rejected:

```
Attempt 1: Maker revises with reviewer feedback
Attempt 2: Maker revises with stricter constraints + full reviewer context
Attempt 3: Maker revises with maximum constraints + full context dump

After 3 failed attempts:
  → HALT
  → Report to human with full failure history
  → DO NOT retry silently
```

## Usage Examples

```
/tribunal-full audit all changes since last commit
```

## After /tribunal-full — Next Steps

| Outcome                    | Next Command                                   |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| All 19 reviewers approve   | → `/deploy` — highest confidence state         |
| Reject with multiple fixes | → `/fix` for simple issues, `/debug` for logic |
| Performance rejection      | → `/tribunal-speed` for granular profiling     |
| Security rejection         | → Immediate `/tribunal-backend` to resolve     |
