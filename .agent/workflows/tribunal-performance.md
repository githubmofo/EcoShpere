# /tribunal-performance — Performance Audit

$ARGUMENTS

---

## $CONTEXT_REQUIRED

```
Read BEFORE performance review:
□ Target code files           → The code being optimized
□ package.json                → Check for known heavy libraries (e.g. moment, lodash)
□ Next.js / bundler config    → Check for bundle optimization settings
```

---

## When to Use /tribunal-performance

| Use `/tribunal-performance` when... | Use something else when...              |
| :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| LCP, INP, or CLS is above threshold | General code review → `/tribunal-full`  |
| Bundle size is too large            | Backend perf only → `/tribunal-backend` |
| Memory usage grows unbounded        | Database perf → `/tribunal-database`    |
| Node.js event loop is saturated     |                                         |
| Optimizing rendering performance    |                                         |

## 3 Active Reviewers (All Run Simultaneously)

### precedence-reviewer → Checks local repo Case Law for past rejections

logic-reviewer

- Expensive computation in render function (runs every render)
- Missing memoization where React.memo/useMemo would help
- Infinite re-render loop (effect updates a value that triggers the effect)

### performance-reviewer

- INP: expensive synchronous work on user interaction (> 50ms blocking)
- LCP: hero image without priority={true} or preload hint
- CLS: missing width/height on images causing layout shift
- Bundle: large library imported without tree-shaking or dynamic import
- Memory: event listeners added without cleanup in useEffect
- N+1: database queries in loop should be batched
- Cache: expensive DB query without Redis/memory cache

## 2026 CWV Targets (Verdict Reference)

| Metric | Good    | Needs Work | Poor (REJECTED) |
| :----- | :------ | :--------- | :-------------- |
| INP    | < 200ms | 200–500ms  | > 500ms         |
| LCP    | < 2.5s  | 2.5–4.0s   | > 4.0s          |
| CLS    | < 0.1   | 0.1–0.25   | > 0.25          |

---

## Verdict System

```
If code contains patterns causing POOR rating → ❌ REJECTED
If code contains patterns causing NEEDS WORK → ⚠️ WARNING
If all patterns cause GOOD rating → ✅ APPROVED
```

## Performance-Specific Hallucination Traps

```typescript
// ❌ React.memo doesn't help when parent re-renders with new objects every time
const MemoCard = React.memo(Card);
<MemoCard style={{ margin: 8 }} /> // New object {} every render → memo has no effect

// ✅ Memoize the object itself
const cardStyle = useMemo(() => ({ margin: 8 }), []);
<MemoCard style={cardStyle} />

// ❌ useMemo with no deps array — runs every render (same as no memo)
const sorted = useMemo(() => items.sort(...)); // Missing deps array!

// ✅ Correct deps array
const sorted = useMemo(() => [...items].sort(compareFn), [items]);

// ❌ Non-measurement claim
// "This is fast" — never write this without a Lighthouse score to back it
```

---

## Measurement Protocol

Performance optimization without measurement is guessing:

```
Before optimizing:
□ Run Lighthouse: record LCP, INP, CLS, bundle size
□ Profile with Chrome DevTools: identify actual bottleneck

After optimizing:
□ Run Lighthouse again: confirm improvement
□ Show before/after scores in audit output
```

---

## Usage Examples

```
/tribunal-performance the product listing page with image grid
/tribunal-performance the search component with real-time filtering
/tribunal-performance the checkout flow for CWV compliance
/tribunal-performance the API route with expensive DB query for caching
```

## After /tribunal-performance — Next Steps

| Outcome                        | Next Command                                   |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Fixes identified               | → `/enhance` to safely apply the optimizations |
| Before/After comparison needed | → `/performance-benchmarker` to run Lighthouse |
| Need to verify full stack perf | → `/tribunal-speed` for DB and server layers   |
| Issues span multiple layers    | → `/refactor` to restructure efficiently       |
