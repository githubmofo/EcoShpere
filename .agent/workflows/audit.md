# /audit — Complete Project Health Assessment

$ARGUMENTS

---

## $CONTEXT_REQUIRED

```
Read BEFORE auditing:
□ package.json                → Identify all configured scripts and dependencies
□ Config files                 → tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js, jest.config.js
□ .agent/scripts/              → Check which audit scripts exist and are executable
```

## When to Use /audit

| Use `/audit` when...             | Use something else when...                    |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Before a major release or launch | Single file review → `/review`                |
| After a security incident        | Just lint errors → `/fix`                     |
| Onboarding to a new codebase     | Performance only → `/performance-benchmarker` |
| Weekly/monthly health check      | Testing only → `/test`                        |
| Before major dependency updates  |                                               |

## Execution Order (Fixed — Do Not Reorder)

Security failures early in the pipeline halt subsequent steps. Lint/test failures continue with flags.

```
Priority 1 — Security (HALT if critical finding)
  node .agent/scripts/security_scan.js .

Priority 2 — Dependencies (HALT if exploitable CVE found)
  node .agent/scripts/dependency_analyzer.js . --audit

Priority 3 — Type Checking (CONTINUE but flag)
  npx tsc --noEmit

Priority 4 — Lint (CONTINUE but flag as deployment blocker)
  node .agent/scripts/lint_runner.js .

Priority 5 — Schema Validation (CONTINUE but flag)
  node .agent/scripts/schema_validator.js .

Priority 6 — Tests (CONTINUE but mark incomplete)
  node .agent/scripts/test_runner.js . --coverage

Priority 7 — Bundle Analysis (INFORM only)
  node .agent/scripts/bundle_analyzer.js . --build
```

### Cascade Failure Rules

| Check                              | Failure Behavior                          |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Security scan (critical)           | **HALT** — all subsequent steps cancelled |
| Dependency audit (exploitable CVE) | **HALT** — fix before proceeding          |
| Lint + type errors                 | **CONTINUE** — flag as deployment blocker |
| Tests failing                      | **CONTINUE** — mark task as incomplete    |
| Bundle analysis (large)            | **INFORM** — no blocking                  |

## Script Retry Protocol

```
Script exits 0:     Success — continue pipeline
Script exits 1:     Failure — report and decide: retry or skip?
Script not found:   Skip with warning — do not block pipeline
Script times out:   Kill after 5 min — report timeout — continue
Script crashes:     Catch exception — report stack trace — continue
```

**Hard limit: 3 retries per script.** After 3 failures, report to human and continue with remaining scripts.

## Audit Report Format

```
━━━ Audit Report: [Project Name] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Score: [N/7 checks passed]

1. Security Scan:         ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED (CRITICAL — HALTED) | ⚠️ WARNINGS
2. Dependency Audit:      ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED (CVE-XXXX-XXXX found) | ⚠️ WARNINGS
3. TypeScript:            ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED (N errors)
4. Lint:                  ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED (N errors, M warnings)
5. Schema Validation:     ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED | N/A
6. Test Coverage:         ✅ PASSED | ❌ FAILED (N% — below 80% threshold)
7. Bundle Size:           ✅ GOOD (310kb) | ⚠️ LARGE (>500kb) | ❌ CRITICAL (>1mb)

━━━ Critical Issues (Fix Before Deploy) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- [CRITICAL] SQL injection in src/routes/users.ts:47
- [HIGH] JWT secret from hardcoded fallback in src/lib/auth.ts:12

━━━ Important Issues (Fix Before Release) ━━━━━━━━━━
- [MEDIUM] 4 TypeScript 'any' types in src/components/
- [MEDIUM] Test coverage: 58% (target: 80%)

━━━ Recommendations ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Update lodash 4.17.20 → 4.17.21 (Prototype pollution CVE)
- Add @types/node to devDependencies (missing)
- Bundle size: chart library causes +240kb — use dynamic import

━━━ Suggested Next Steps ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Critical items → /tribunal-backend to fix injection and JWT issues
Test gaps → /test to add coverage for checkout and auth flows
Bundle → /enhance to add dynamic import for chart component
```

## Human Review Gate

After the audit report is produced:

```
Human Gate required before any fixes are applied.

Approve a fix plan?
Y = proceed with automated fixes where safe
N = report only, no changes
S = select specific items to fix
```

No files are modified without explicit approval.

## After /audit — Next Steps

| Outcome                      | Next Command                                    |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Security/Dependency failures | → `/tribunal-backend` to implement secure fixes |
| Lint/Type errors             | → `/fix` for automated cleanup                  |
| Test coverage missing        | → `/test` to generate missing tests             |
| Audit clean                  | → `/deploy` if preparing for release            |
