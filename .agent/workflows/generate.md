description: Generate code using the full Tribunal Anti-Hallucination pipeline. Maker generates grounded in real project context at low temperature → domain-selected reviewers audit in parallel → Human Gate for final approval. Nothing is written to disk without explicit approval.

# /generate — Hallucination-Free Code Generation

$ARGUMENTS

---

## $CONTEXT_REQUIRED

```
Read BEFORE generating any code (MANDATORY — never skip):
□ package.json      → Verify all imports exist before using them
□ tsconfig.json     → Understand strictness, paths aliases, target version
□ context/*.acf     → Load explicit goals, rules, and boundaries
□ .env.example      → Know available environment variables
□ Referenced files   → Understand actual data shapes and types
```

## When to Use /generate

| Use `/generate` when...                      | Use something else when...                     |
| :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| New code needs to be written from scratch    | Existing code needs modification → `/enhance`  |
| A single focused piece of code is needed     | Multi-domain build → `/create` or `/swarm`     |
| A safe, reviewed snippet is required         | You want to understand options first → `/plan` |
| You need a quick but Tribunal-reviewed piece | Full project structure needed → `/create`      |

## What the Maker Is Not Allowed to Do

```
❌ Import a package not in package.json
❌ Call a method not verified in official documentation
❌ Use TypeScript 'any' without an explanation comment
❌ Generate an entire application in one shot
❌ Guess at database column or table names (read schema first)
❌ Fabricate API response shapes (read existing types first)
❌ Assume environment variables exist (read .env.example first)
❌ Use Next.js 14 patterns in a Next.js 15 project (check version!)
❌ Use React 18 hooks in a React 19 project (useFormState → useActionState)
❌ Use framer-motion v6 API in a v12 project (exitBeforeEnter → mode="wait")
❌ Use raw useEffect for GSAP — always useGSAP from @gsap/react
❌ Hallucinate LLM model names — verify against provider's current model list
```

When unsure: write `// VERIFY: [specific reason]` instead of hallucinating.

## Reviewer Auto-Selection

**Always active:**

```
precedence-reviewer→ Enforces repository Case Law and past rejections (Runs First)
logic-reviewer     → Hallucinated methods, undefined refs, impossible logic
security-auditor   → OWASP vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, injection
complexity-reviewer→ Enforces the Dependency Ladder to prevent over-engineering
```

**Auto-activated by keywords:**

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Verdict       | Meaning            | What Happens                              |
| :------------ | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `✅ APPROVED` | No issues found    | Proceeds to Human Gate                    |
| `⚠️ WARNING`  | Non-blocking issue | Human Gate shown with warning highlighted |
| `❌ REJECTED` | Blocking issue     | Maker revises before Human Gate           |

**Retry limit:** Maker is revised up to 3 times per REJECTED verdict. After 3 failures, the session halts and reports to the user with full failure history. No silent failures.
