## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Assuming server data is always newer than local data -> ✅ Conflicts are inevitable; design merge strategy (LWW, CRDTs) before writing code
- ❌ Using localStorage for anything beyond 5MB -> ✅ Use IndexedDB (via Dexie or idb) for structured local storage; localStorage is synchronous and tiny
- ❌ Syncing entire datasets on every connection -> ✅ Use incremental sync with watermarks/timestamps to minimize bandwidth

# Local-First Architecture — Offline-capable Mastery

---

## 1. Core Principles of Local-First

In a Cloud-First app (REST/GraphQL), the UI waits for the server.
In a Local-First app, the UI talks _only_ to a local database. A background engine syncs that database to the cloud when online.

1. **Fast by default**: Zero network latency because reads/writes happen locally.
2. **Offline works flawlessly**: The app bounds to a local store (SQLite via WASM, IndexedDB).
3. **Multi-device Sync**: Conflict resolution is handled natively (usually via CRDTs or central conflict ledgers).

---

## 2. Sync Engines vs traditional fetching

Do not use React Query / SWR to build local-first. They are HTTP caching mechanisms.

```typescript
// ❌ CLOUD-FIRST (React Query / Fetch)
// Fails when offline. Subject to UI latency.
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["todos"],
  queryFn: () => fetch("/api/todos").then((res) => res.json()),
});

// ✅ LOCAL-FIRST (e.g. PowerSync / ElectricSQL / WatermelonDB)
// Resolves instantly. Data lives locally. Syncs silently in background.
import { useQuery } from "@powersync/react";

const { data, isLoading } = useQuery("SELECT * FROM todos ORDER BY created_at DESC");

// Writes are also local First
const addTodo = async (text: string) => {
  // Written to the local SQLite WASM database instantly.
  await localDb.execute("INSERT INTO todos (id, text) VALUES (uuid(), ?)", [text]);
  // Background worker syncs to Postgres later.
};
```

---

## 3. Conflict Resolution (CRDTs)

When two users edit the exact same document offline and then reconnect, how is it resolved?

**Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** automatically merge data without requiring a central server to decide the "winner."

```typescript
// Yjs - The leading CRDT library for collaborative text/state
import * as Y from "yjs";
import { WebsocketProvider } from "y-websocket";

const ydoc = new Y.Doc();
const provider = new WebsocketProvider("wss://sync.example.com", "room-1", ydoc);

// Shared state array
const yarray = ydoc.getArray("todos");

// Observe changes (Fires locally and when peers sync)
yarray.observe((event) => {
  console.log("State updated natively without conflict:", yarray.toArray());
});

// Insert data (Instantly merges cleanly with remote peers)
yarray.insert(0, ["Buy milk"]);
```

## 4. In-Browser Databases

Storing megabytes of relational data in `localStorage` will crash the browser.

| Technology             | Use Case      | Pros                                | Cons                                          |
| :--------------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **IndexedDB**          | Key-Value     | Native to browser                   | Hideous callback API, weak querying           |
| **Dexie.js**           | Key-Value     | Wraps IndexedDB with clean Promises | Not relational                                |
| **SQLite WASM (OPFS)** | Relational    | True SQL in browser                 | Setup complexity (Origin Private File System) |
| **RxDB**               | NoSQL Offline | Reactive UI out-of-the-box          | Requires learning RxJS/Observables            |
| **WatermelonDB**       | Relational    | Built for React Native & Web        | Requires native module setup on mobile        |

```typescript
// Clean IndexedDB Wrapper Example (Dexie)
import Dexie, { type EntityTable } from "dexie";

interface Friend {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const db = new Dexie("FriendsDatabase") as Dexie & {
  friends: EntityTable<Friend, "id">;
};

// Schema configuration
db.version(1).stores({
  friends: "++id, name, age", // Primary key and indexed props
});

// Write to DB instantly
await db.friends.add({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });

// Live query natively drives React state without network calls
import { useLiveQuery } from "dexie-react-hooks";
const friends = useLiveQuery(() => db.friends.where("age").above(21).toArray());
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
