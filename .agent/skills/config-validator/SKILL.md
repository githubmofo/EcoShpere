## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Silently using default values for missing config -> ✅ Fail fast with a clear error message naming the missing field
- ❌ Trusting environment variables without validation -> ✅ Validate ALL env vars at startup with Zod or a schema, not at usage time
- ❌ Mixing config source precedence without documenting it -> ✅ Document: CLI args > env vars > config file > defaults

---

# Config Validator — System Integrity Mastery

---

## 1. Fail Fast, Fail Loudly

Never allow a system to boot, run, or proceed into a workflow if the underlying configuration is invalid. Parse configurations at the absolute boundary.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// ❌ VULNERABLE: Implicit Trust
// Assumes the JSON file is correct. Will crash randomly deep in the execution stack
// if 'maxRetries' is missing or set to a string.
const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./.agent/config.json", "utf8"));
runAgent(config.maxRetries);

// ✅ SAFE: Boundary Validation via Zod
const ConfigSchema = z.object({
  version: z.string().regex(/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/),
  maxRetries: z.number().min(0).max(10).default(3),
  enabledSkills: z.array(z.string()),
  environment: z.enum(["development", "production", "test"]),
  apiEndpoint: z.string().url().optional(),
});

try {
  const rawData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./.agent/config.json", "utf8"));
  const config = ConfigSchema.parse(rawData); // Throws heavily detailed error instantly
} catch (err) {
  logger.fatal("System boot aborted. Invalid config.json:", err.errors);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

---

## 2. Directory & Manifest Self-Auditing

Configuration files often reference physical system assets (scripts, workflows, other config files). The validator must check referential integrity.

If `manifest.json` says `{"workflow": "scripts/deploy.sh"}`, the validator MUST verify that `scripts/deploy.sh` actually exists before the orchestrator tries to run it.

```typescript
// Validating Referential Integrity
function auditAgentDirectory(config: Config) {
  const missingFiles = [];

  for (const skill of config.enabledSkills) {
    const skillPath = path.join(".agent/skills", skill, "SKILL.md");
    if (!fs.existsSync(skillPath)) {
      missingFiles.push(`Skill manifest definition missing: ${skillPath}`);
    }
  }

  if (missingFiles.length > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Referential Integrity Failure:\n${missingFiles.join("\n")}`);
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Environment Variable Validation

Missing or malformed `.env` files are the #1 cause of deployment failure.

Treat environment variables exactly like JSON configs: apply a rigid schema mapping at boot.

```typescript
// Instead of checking process.env.DATABASE_URL throughout the app,
// export a strictly validated object once.

// src/env.ts
import { z } from "zod";

const EnvSchema = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  PORT: z.coerce.number().default(3000), // Transforms string "3000" to number 3000
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development", "production"]).default("development"),
  API_KEY: z.string().min(16), // Ensures keys aren't empty or mock data
});

export const ENV = EnvSchema.parse(process.env);
```

---

## 4. Safe Configuration Mutation

When automating updates to a JSON configuration (e.g., adding a new skill to `config.json`), never serialize over the original file blindly.

1. **Read** original JSON.
2. **Apply** modifications in memory.
3. **Validate** the new object against the Zod schema.
4. **Write** atomically (write to `config.json.tmp`, then standard OS file rename to `config.json` to prevent corruption if power dies mid-write).

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
