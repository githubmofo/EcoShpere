## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Using `page.waitForTimeout(3000)` for synchronization -> ✅ Use `page.waitForSelector()`, `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, or auto-waiting locators
- ❌ Using CSS selectors or XPath for test locators -> ✅ Use `getByRole()`, `getByLabel()`, `getByTestId()` for resilient selectors
- ❌ Running tests without `--workers=1` in CI debug mode -> ✅ Parallel tests with shared state cause flaky failures; isolate tests properly
- ❌ Not using `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` when tests have ordering dependencies -> ✅ Explicitly mark serial when needed

# Playwright E2E — Bulletproof Testing Mastery

---

## 1. Resilience & Auto-Waiting

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable (visible, stable, not obscured).

```typescript
// ❌ FLAKY: Hardcoded sleeps. Fails on slow CI, wastes time on fast local rings.
await page.waitForTimeout(3000);

// ❌ FLAKY: CSS selectors tied to layout/styling changes
await page.locator(".btn-primary > span").click();

// ✅ ROBUST: Playwright auto-waits for actionability based on user-centric selectors
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit Checkout" }).click();

// ✅ ROBUST: Testing for expected states
await expect(page.getByText("Order confirmed")).toBeVisible();
```

### The Selector Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

1. `page.getByRole()` — Checks accessibility simultaneously.
2. `page.getByText()` — Finds elements by raw text values.
3. `page.getByTestId()` — Resilient to text/translation updates (`data-testid`).
4. `page.locator('css')` — Brittle, bound to DOM structures. Use only as last resort.

---

## 2. Test Isolation & Fixtures

Do not cascade tests (where Test B requires Test A to pass first). Playwright gives every test a blank browser context isolated from the rest.

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

// ❌ BAD: Cascading state
test.describe("Dashboard", () => {
  test("Login", async ({ page }) => {
    await login(page); // Next test assumes this succeeded
  });
  test("Action", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" }).click();
  });
});

// ✅ GOOD: Isolated tests via beforeEach or Custom Fixtures
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  // Login directly via API to bypass slow UI login, seeding cookies
  await performFastApiLogin(page);
  await page.goto("/dashboard");
});

test("Should save settings", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole("alert")).toHaveText("Saved successfully");
});
```

---

## 3. Network Mocking

E2E tests that rely on external 3rd party APIs (Stripe, SendGrid) will fail randomly due to network latency outside your control.

```typescript
test("Should block invalid credit cards", async ({ page }) => {
  // Intercept the outgoing request to the payment processor
  await page.route("**/api/v1/charge*", async (route) => {
    // Return a mocked failure response immediately
    const json = { status: "declined", message: "Insufficient funds" };
    await route.fulfill({ status: 400, json });
  });

  await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Purchase" }).click();
  await expect(page.getByText("Insufficient funds")).toBeVisible();
});
```

---

## 4. Configuration for CI/CD

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: "./tests/e2e",
  fullyParallel: true, // Run tests concurrently
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI, // Fail build if `.only` was left in code
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0, // Retry flakes on CI only
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined, // Reduce CI overload
  reporter: "html",

  use: {
    trace: "on-first-retry", // Record trace viewer ONLY on failure to save space
    video: "retain-on-failure",
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
  },

  projects: [
    { name: "chromium", use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] } },
    { name: "webkit", use: { ...devices["Desktop Safari"] } },
    // Mobile Viewport Example
    { name: "Mobile Safari", use: { ...devices["iPhone 13"] } },
  ],

  // Spin up local server before running tests
  webServer: {
    command: "npm run build && npm run start",
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
