## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Scripts without `set -euo pipefail` -> ✅ Always enable strict mode to catch silent failures
- ❌ Using `[ ]` instead of `[[ ]]` for conditionals -> ✅ `[[ ]]` handles spaces in variables and supports regex
- ❌ Parsing `ls` output -> ✅ Use `find` or glob expansion instead; `ls` output is not portable
- ❌ `cat file | grep` (useless use of cat) -> ✅ `grep pattern file` directly

# Bash & Linux — Shell Scripting Mastery

---

## 1. Bash Strict Mode (Mandatory)

Always start every single bash script with strict compilation flags.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ❌ BAD: Default bash execution
# - Undefined variables evaluate to empty strings
# - Failed commands are ignored, execution continues blindly
# - Piped failures are hidden (only last command exit code matters)

# ✅ GOOD: Strict Mode
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

# -e: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# -u: Treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately.
# -o pipefail: Pipeline returns the status of the rightmost command to exit with a non-zero status.
# IFS: Only split on newlines and tabs, not spaces (prevents terrifying globbing/array bugs).

# Example: Catching potential disasters
unset MY_VAR
rm -rf "/some/path/${MY_VAR}" # With 'set -u', this throws an error instead of running 'rm -rf /some/path/'
```

## 2. Advanced Stream Manipulation

Piping allows passing stdout from one program into stdin of another.

```bash
# ❌ VULNERABLE: Useless Use of Cat (UUOC)
cat file.txt | grep "error"

# ✅ EFFICIENT: Direct parsing
grep "error" file.txt
# Or modern ripgrep for huge repositories:
rg "error" file.txt

# Process Substitution: Treating tool outputs as if they were files
# Compare two remote JSON responses without writing to disk
diff <(curl -s api.com/v1) <(curl -s api.com/v2)

# Redirection Mastery
# 1> stdout, 2> stderr
command > output.txt 2> error.txt   # Split streams
command > all.txt 2>&1              # Combine streams (POSIX)
command &> all.txt                  # Combine streams (Bash shortcut)
command >/dev/null 2>&1             # Subdue all output cleanly
```

---

## 3. AWK and Stream Formatting

AWK is a complete programming language designed for text processing.

```bash
# Example: We have a ps aux output and we want the PIDs (column 2) of all Node processes
ps aux | grep node | awk '{print $2}'

# Example: Summing numbers in column 3 from a CSV
cat data.csv | awk -F ',' '{sum+=$3} END {print sum}'

# Extracting specific lines (e.g. line 5 to 10)
sed -n '5,10p' file.txt
```

## 4. Modern CLI Alternatives (The 2026 Stack)

Standard POSIX tools are reliable but slow. Use modern Rust-based alternatives when available in CI/CD.

| Task               | Legacy POSIX          | Modern Alternative | Why?                                                          |
| :----------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Find files         | `find . -name "*.ts"` | `fd -e ts`         | Context-aware, respects `.gitignore`, 10x faster.             |
| Search text        | `grep -r "auth"`      | `rg "auth"`        | Ripgrep uses multi-threading and SIMD instructions.           |
| Inspect JSON       | `grep / awk`          | `jq '.users[].id'` | `jq` explicitly parses and filters valid JSON arrays/objects. |
| Process monitoring | `top`                 | `htop` / `btm`     | Interactive metrics.                                          |
| Check curl         | `curl -i`             | `httpie` / `xh`    | Colorized, structured JSON networking.                        |

## 5. File System Traps & Quoting

If a filename contains a space and you didn't quote your variable, your script will crash or delete the wrong files.

```bash
# Let FILE="my backup.tar"

# ❌ BAD: Evaluates as `rm my` AND `backup.tar` -> Two different files!
rm $FILE

# ✅ GOOD: Always quote string variables
rm "$FILE"

# ✅ GOOD: Array iteration (Using quotes specifically formatted with @)
FILES=("file 1.txt" "file 2.txt")
for file in "${FILES[@]}"; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
done
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
