## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Dispatching sub-agents without a context_summary -> ✅ Always send a trimmed context, never the full conversation
- ❌ Assuming sub-agents share memory -> ✅ Each agent invocation is stateless unless explicitly passed context
- ❌ Running agents sequentially when they are independent -> ✅ Use fan-out/fan-in for parallelizable work

# Agent Organizer — Multi-Agent Orchestration Mastery

---

## 1. The Delegation Sub-Agent Pattern

Agents should defer specific domain problems to specialized sub-agents.

```json
// Define the payload contract the Worker Agent expects
{
  "taskId": "task-auth-migration-01",
  "workerRole": "api-security-auditor",
  "isolatedContext": {
    "filesToScan": ["src/login.ts", "src/middleware.ts"],
    "objective": "Identify unprotected mass assignments"
  },
  "requiredOutputFormat": "json_list"
}
```

### Delegation Rules:

1. **Never pass full histories:** Do not pass the entire conversation history to a worker sub-agent. Extract only the exact files and goal context required. (Context Window Budgeting).
2. **Clear Boundaries:** If the worker is fixing CSS, it must not invent logic for the database.
3. **Structured Handoff:** The parent agent requests JSON from the worker, parses it, and then acts. Let machines talk to machines through syntax, not prose.

---

## 2. Execution Loops (Supervisor Pattern)

A Supervisor decides _who_ works and _when_, but does not execute the work.

```
[User Request: "Add OAuth and secure it"]
       |
[Supervisor Agent analyzing required skills...]
       |
       ├─> [Dispatches: authentication-best-practices]
       |         (Worker builds OAuth implementation)
       |
       ├─> [Dispatches: api-security-auditor]
       |         (Worker reviews implementation against OWASP)
       |
[Supervisor Agent synthesizes findings]
       |
[Action Executed / Git Commit]
```

### Handoff Signals

A worker must return definitive state signals when yielding control:

- `COMPLETE`: Goal achieved. Final diff generated.
- `BLOCKED`: Missing context (e.g., "I need the `.env` schema").
- `ERROR`: Script failed, requires manual Supervisor intervention.

---

## 3. Session State Management (Memory)

Agents lose memory across boundaries. The Organizer must explicitly persist context.

1. **Short-Term Context:** Maintained natively in the active LLM context window.
2. **Task State:** Maintained locally in `task.md`. Workers check-in and check-out checkboxes.
3. **Long-Term Memory:** "Knowledge Items" (KIs). Distilling massive conversations down into a single `learnings.json` file injected on subsequent startups.

```markdown
<!-- task.md (The Global Execution State) -->

# Current Objective: Build Chat Feature

- [x] Initialize websocket connection
- [/] (Worker: frontend-specialist) Build Chat UI component
- [ ] (Worker: realtime-patterns) Implement presence sync
```

---

## 4. The Human-in-the-Loop (Socratic Gate)

Automation without oversight is reckless. The Organizer manages when to pause and query the human.

**Mandatory Gates:**

1. **Approval Gate (Before Execution):** "I have drafted the architecture plan. Do you approve execution?"
2. **Recovery Gate (After 3 Failures):** "The database migration script has failed 3 times. I am halting. How would you like to proceed?"

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
