## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Jumping to implementation during brainstorming -> ✅ Brainstorming is exploration only; no code is written in this phase
- ❌ Presenting only one option -> ✅ Always present 3+ distinct approaches with tradeoffs
- ❌ Assuming the user's first request is their real need -> ✅ Ask 'what problem does this solve for your users?' before generating ideas

---

# Brainstorming — Socratic Exploration Mastery

---

## 1. The Socratic Protocol (Mandatory Delay)

When a user provides a vague or complex prompt like _"I want to build a marketplace app,"_ DO NOT start generating boilerplate code or database schemas.

**You must act as a Socratic filter.**

1. Acknowledge the ambition of the goal.
2. Provide 3-5 distinct architectural/functional pathways the user could take.
3. Pause execution. Demand the user makes definitive decisions regarding the permutations before proceeding.

### Example Socratic Prompting:

Instead of: _"Here is the React code for your marketplace,"_
Output: _"Before we write the code, we must lock down the payment flow. Do you want to: A) Handle escrow directly (High liability, complex payout logic), B) Use Stripe Connect (Easy routing, strict KYC requirements), or C) Operate free-listing only (Zero liability, requires external monetization)?"_

---

## 2. Multi-Dimensional Tradeoff Analysis

Every design choice has drawbacks. The brainstorming agent must illuminate the implicit consequences of the user's requests.

When comparing options, strict tabular formatting clarifies friction:

| Approach                 | Speed to Market | Operational Cost            | Latency / UX               | Maintenance Burden                  |
| :----------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **Serverless Functions** | Very high       | Low initially (pay-per-use) | Cold starts (500ms delay)  | Complex local testing               |
| **Monolithic Node VPS**  | Moderate        | Flat ($10/mo fixed)         | Extremely fast (0ms start) | Requires manual OS patching         |
| **Edge Compute (V8)**    | Low             | Moderate                    | Global low-latency         | Strict 1MB limits / V8 restrictions |

_Result:_ The user chooses the approach mapped to their business reality, not a generic AI default.

---

## 3. Lateral Expansion (The "What If?" Matrix)

Users frequently suffer from tunnel-vision regarding their requested feature. The Brainstormer introduces lateral features the user hasn't considered yet to solidify the schema boundaries.

If user asks for: **"A habit tracking calendar."**
_Expand laterally:_

- "What if a user crosses timezones frequently? Do streaks break?"
- "What if they track binary habits (Read: Yes/No) versus quantitative habits (Drink 6 Liters of water)?"
- "What if they require offline capability while on airplanes?"

---

## 4. Distilling Decisions into Assertions

Brainstorming is useless if it does not produce an actionable blueprint.
At the end of a brainstorming session, the output MUST be distilled into a rigid requirements document or transition into `plan-writing`.

```markdown
# Final Brainstorming Assertions

1. **Architecture:** Next.js SSR Monolith
2. **Database:** Postgres via Prisma (Required for complex relational queries)
3. **Payment:** Stripe Connect (Subverted liability)
4. **Auth:** NextAuth (Google Provider only for MVP)
```

---

## Dynamic Question Generation

**PRINCIPLE:** Questions are not about gathering data—they are about **revealing architectural consequences**.

Every question must connect to a concrete implementation decision that affects cost, complexity, or timeline.

---

### 🧠 Core Principles

#### 1. Questions Reveal Consequences

A good question is not "What color do you want?" but:

```markdown
❌ BAD: "What authentication method?"
✅ GOOD: "Should users sign up with email/password or social login?

Impact:

- Email/Pass → Need password reset, hashing, 2FA infrastructure
- Social → OAuth providers, user profile mapping, less control

Trade-off: Security vs. Development time vs. User friction"
```

#### 2. Context Before Content

First understand **where** this request fits:

| Context                      | Question Focus                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Greenfield** (new project) | Foundation decisions: stack, hosting, scale                |
| **Feature Addition**         | Integration points, existing patterns, breaking changes    |
| **Refactor**                 | Why refactor? Performance? Maintainability? What's broken? |

#### 3. Minimum Viable Questions

**PRINCIPLE:** Each question must eliminate a fork in the implementation road.

```
Before Question:
├── Path A: Do X (5 min)
├── Path B: Do Y (15 min)
└── Path C: Do Z (1 hour)

After Question:
└── Path Confirmed: Do X (5 min)
```

If a question doesn't reduce implementation paths → **DELETE IT**.

#### 4. Questions Generate Data, Not Assumptions

```markdown
❌ ASSUMPTION: "User probably wants Stripe for payments"
✅ QUESTION: "Which payment provider fits your needs?

Stripe → Best documentation, 2.9% + $0.30, US-centric
LemonSqueezy → Merchant of Record, 5% + $0.50, global taxes
Paddle → Complex pricing, handles EU VAT, enterprise focus"
```

### 📊 Generated Output (Example)

```

### 🔴 CRITICAL DECISIONS (Cannot Proceed Without Answers)

#### 1. **Photo Storage Strategy**

**Question:** Where will user photos be stored and served?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Monthly hosting costs, page load speed, CDN complexity
- High-volume social apps: 1000 users × 10 photos × 2MB = 20GB storage

**Options:**
|Option|Cost|Speed|Complexity|Best For|
|--------|------|-------|------------|----------|
|**Cloudinary**|$89/mo (25GB)|Fast (CDN)|Low|MVP, rapid launch|
|**AWS S3 + CloudFront**|$0.023/GB|Fast (CDN)|Medium|Production, cost-optimized|
|**Supabase Storage**|Free tier 1GB|Medium|Low|Small scale, simple|
|**Local Storage**|Server cost|Slow|Low|Development only|

**If Not Specified:** Cloudinary (balanced for MVP)

---

#### 2. **Feed Algorithm Choice**

**Question:** How should the main feed work?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Database query complexity, caching strategy, development time
- Algorithmic feeds require ML infrastructure, ranking signals

**Options:**
|Option|Complexity|Database Impact|Best For|
|--------|------------|-----------------|----------|
|**Chronological**|Low|Simple query|Early stage, transparency|
|**Follow-Only**|Medium|JOIN with pagination|Most social apps|
|**Algorithmic**|High|Pre-computed feed tables|Instagram competitor|

**If Not Specified:** Follow-Only (balanced for social app)

---

#### 3. **Authentication Approach**

**Question:** How do users sign up and login?

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects: Development time (2-5 hours), security posture, UX friction

**Options:**
|Option|Dev Time|Security|UX|Best For|
|--------|----------|----------|-----|----------|
|**Email/Password**|4-5 hrs|High (if 2FA)|Medium|Full control needed|
|**Social Only**|1-2 hrs|Provider-dependent|Smooth|B2C, rapid launch|
|**Magic Link**|2-3 hrs|Medium|Very smooth|Security-focused|
|**Clerk/Auth0**|1 hr|High|Smooth|Fastest to market|

**If Not Specified:** Clerk (fastest for MVP)

---

### 🟡 HIGH-LEVERAGE (Affects Architecture)

#### 4. **Real-time Notifications**

**Question:** Do users need instant notifications for likes/comments?

**Why This Matters:**
- WebSocket adds infrastructure complexity (Redis pub/sub for scaling)
- Polling is simpler but higher latency

**Options:**
|Option|Complexity|Scale Cost|Best For|
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
|**WebSocket + Redis**|High|$10+/mo|>1000 concurrent users|
|**Polling (30s)**|Low|DB queries|<1000 users|
|**No Real-time**|None|None|MVP, validate first|

**If Not Specified:** Polling for MVP (defer WebSocket until validated)

---

### 🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE (Defer to v2)

#### 5. **Video/Reels Support**
- Major complexity (video processing, streaming infrastructure)
- Recommendation: Launch with photos only, add video after validation

#### 6. **Direct Messaging**
- Separate subsystem (chat infrastructure different from feed)
- Recommendation: Use Pusher/Stream for real-time or defer entirely

---

### 📋 Summary

|Decision|Recommendation|If Changed|
|----------|----------------|------------|
|Storage|Cloudinary|+3 hrs setup|
|Feed|Follow-only|+2 hrs query optimization|
|Auth|Clerk|-3 hrs dev time|
|Real-time|Polling|+5 hrs WebSocket setup|
|Video|Defer to v2|N/A|
|DM|Defer to v2|N/A|

**Total Estimated MVP Time:** 15-20 hours with recommendations above
```

---

### 🎯 Principles Recap

1. **Every question = Architectural decision** → Not data gathering
2. **Show trade-offs** → User understands consequences
3. **Prioritize blocking decisions** → Cannot proceed without
4. **Provide defaults** → If user doesn't answer, we proceed anyway
5. **Domain-aware** → Ecommerce questions ≠ Auth questions ≠ Real-time questions
6. **Iterative** → More questions as patterns emerge during implementation

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
