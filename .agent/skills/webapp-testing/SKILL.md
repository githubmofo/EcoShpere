## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Mocking everything in integration tests -> ✅ Integration tests verify real interactions; mock only external services (APIs, DBs)
- ❌ Testing Library: using `getByTestId` as the primary selector -> ✅ Prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText` for user-centric testing
- ❌ Writing E2E tests that depend on seed data -> ✅ Each test should create its own data in setup and clean up in teardown

# Webapp Testing — Full Stack Pipeline Mastery

## 1. The Strategy (The Testing Trophy)

The traditional "Testing Pyramid" (lots of Unit, little E2E) is outdated for rich UI applications. Use the **Testing Trophy**:

1. **Static Analysis (10%)**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier (Catches typos and type mismatches instantly).
2. **Unit Tests (20%)**: Vitest (Tests complex pure functions: math, formatting, data mapping).
3. **Integration Tests (60%)**: React Testing Library + MSW (Tests components and network mock interactions together).
4. **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Playwright (Tests the critical path: Login, Checkout, Account Creation on a real browser).

---

## 2. Integration Layer (React Testing Library + MSW)

Do not mock child components. Render the specific DOM tree and interact with it as a user would.

To prevent network calls, utilize Mock Service Worker (MSW) which intercepts requests at the network layer natively.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Mocking implementation details
jest.mock("axios");
axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { users: [] } });

// ✅ GOOD: MSW (Mock Service Worker) network level interception
// The component functions EXACTLY as it would in production
import { http, HttpResponse } from "msw";
import { setupServer } from "msw/node";

export const handlers = [
  http.get("/api/users", () => {
    return HttpResponse.json([{ id: 1, name: "John Appleseed" }]);
  }),
];
const server = setupServer(...handlers);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

### Component Testing (RTL)

```typescript
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

test('Should load users and render names', async () => {
  // userEvent closely replicates real browser physics (focusing, keystrokes)
  const user = userEvent.setup();

  render(<UserDashboard />);

  // Initial State
  expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Async Resolution (Auto-waits for the MSW mock to return)
  const johnNode = await screen.findByText('John Appleseed');
  expect(johnNode).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Interaction
  const deleteBtn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: "Delete John" });
  await user.click(deleteBtn);

  // Verification
  expect(johnNode).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

---

## 3. Pure Unit Testing (Vitest)

Isolate business logic entirely from React.

```typescript
// ✅ Move complex logic OUT of the React component entirely
export function calculateTax(subtotal: number, state: string): number {
  if (subtotal < 0) throw new Error("Subtotal cannot be negative");
  if (state === "CA") return subtotal * 0.0825;
  return 0; // Default
}

// ✅ Test with extreme precision and coverage
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("calculateTax()", () => {
  it("applies CA tax correctly", () => {
    expect(calculateTax(100, "CA")).toBe(8.25);
  });

  it("throws on negative input", () => {
    expect(() => calculateTax(-50, "CA")).toThrowError("negative");
  });
});
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
