## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Designing mobile-last (desktop first, then shrinking) -> ✅ Design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens
- ❌ Using more than 2-3 font families -> ✅ Stick to 1-2 font families maximum; more creates visual noise
- ❌ Ignoring touch target sizes on mobile -> ✅ Minimum 44x44px touch targets (Apple HIG) / 48x48dp (Material Design)

## Extreme Review Categories

### 1. Neuro-Inclusivity & Accessibility (WCAG 3.0 APCA Base)

Non-negotiable baseline for any public interface in 2026+:

| Check                   | How to Verify                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APCA Contrast**       | Ensure Lc (Lightness Contrast) is > 75 for body text, > 60 for large text. (Do not rely solely on old WCAG 2.1 4.5:1 math).                           |
| **Cognitive Safety**    | Check if `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected. No infinite spinning loaders.                                                                         |
| **Keyboard Fluidity**   | Tab order must follow visual order. Focus states cannot be just a 1px dotted line; use `outline: 2px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 2px;`. |
| **Semantic AI Context** | Images must have `alt` tags, but complex charts need full `<details>` breakdowns for screen readers and AI agents crawling the site.                  |
| **Interaction Buffers** | Are touch targets mathematically ≥48px (Fitts' Law)?                                                                                                  |

### 2. Extreme Core Web Vitals (CWV)

Drop the old 2022 standards. The new baseline for premium web:

| Metric                              | Premium Target | Common Failures                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)  | **< 1.5s**     | Missing `fetchpriority="high"` on hero images. Heavy client-side React rendering blocking the paint. |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | **< 100ms**    | Main thread blocked by React hydrate. Use `startTransition` or Web Workers for heavy JS.             |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)   | **0.00**       | Missing `width` and `height` on images. Late-loading web fonts (use `font-display: optional`).       |

### 3. Energy Efficiency & Sustainability

Code has a carbon footprint and a battery cost.

- **OLED Pure Black:** Does the dark mode use `#000` or `#010101` to physically turn off pixels?
- **Animation Tax:** Are animations using CPU-heavy properties (`margin`, `width`) instead of GPU-accelerated ones (`transform`, `opacity`)?
- **Asset Weight:** Are images AVIF/WebP? Are fonts subsetted Variable Fonts?

### 4. Visual Design Quality (Pro-Max)

Evaluate these brutally honestly:

- **Mathematical Spacing:** Does spacing follow a strict scale (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 24, 32) or is it a mess of arbitrary pixels?
- **Fluid Typography:** Is text using `clamp()` to scale, or does it awkwardly jump at breakpoints?
- **The "Purple Ban":** Is the site heavily relying on deep purple/violet as a primary color? (Flag this as an overused AI-generated cliché).
- **Z-Axis Depth:** Are shadows realistic (multi-layered CSS shadows) or flat and cheap (`box-shadow: 0 4px 6px #000`)?
- **Micro-Interactions:** Do buttons scale down slightly on `:active`? Do elements use spring-physics easing (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`)?

### 5. AI & Streaming UX

- **Zero-Wait States:** If the app is waiting for an LLM/Server response, does it show a static spinner (BAD) or stream the skeleton/content (GOOD)?
- **Optimistic UI:** Do likes/saves update the UI _instantly_ before the server confirms?

## Common Review Findings

| Finding                         | Severity  | Fix                                           |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Missing/Weak focus styles       | High      | Add visible `:focus-visible` with offset      |
| `margin`/`padding` animated     | High      | Change to `transform: translate()`            |
| Touch targets under 48px        | High      | Increase padding/min-height                   |
| Layout shifts on load (CLS > 0) | High      | Pre-allocate space for async content/images   |
| Linear CSS transitions          | Medium    | Upgrade to spring-based `cubic-bezier` curves |
| Purple as primary color         | Low/Brand | Rethink palette — overused AI design cliché   |

```
━━━ Web Design Guidelines Recommendation ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Trade-offs:  [what is consciously accepted]
Next action: [concrete next step for the user]

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
