## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Auto-fixing lint errors without reviewing the diff -> ✅ Some auto-fixes change logic (e.g., removing 'unused' variables that are side-effects)
- ❌ Treating warnings as non-blocking in CI -> ✅ Warnings accumulate; enforce zero-warning policy or they become permanent
- ❌ Running linters only on changed files -> ✅ Run on full codebase periodically; cross-file issues are only caught with full runs

# Linting & Validation

## Why Linting Matters

Linting catches problems that code review misses:

- Unused variables left in after refactoring
- Missing `await` on async functions (silently returns a Promise instead of the value)
- Inconsistent code style that makes diffs hard to read
- Known dangerous patterns (e.g., `==` instead of `===` in JS)

Run linting in CI. Every PR that merges should pass lint. A lint check that doesn't block the build is decoration.

## JavaScript / TypeScript (ESLint + Prettier)

```bash
# Install
npm install -D eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser prettier

# Run
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx
npx prettier --check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix
npx prettier --write .
```

**Recommended rules to enforce:**

```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking"],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/await-thenable": "error",
    "no-console": ["warn", { "allow": ["warn", "error"] }],
    "eqeqeq": ["error", "always"]
  }
}
```

**Key rules explained:**

| Rule                   | Why It Matters                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-floating-promises` | Missing `await` on async call = silent bug                  |
| `no-explicit-any`      | `any` disables TypeScript's only protection                 |
| `eqeqeq`               | `==` has coercion surprises; `===` is always explicit       |
| `await-thenable`       | Prevents `await`-ing non-async functions (always a mistake) |

## Python (Ruff)

Ruff replaces flake8, black, isort, and pyupgrade in one fast tool:

```bash
# Install
pip install ruff

# Check
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable
ruff check . --fix

# Format (replaces black)
ruff format .

# Pre-commit config
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  hooks:
    - id: ruff
      args: [--fix]
    - id: ruff-format
```

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py311"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "UP", "B", "SIM", "ANN"]
# E: pycodestyle, F: pyflakes, I: isort, N: naming, UP: pyupgrade
# B: bugbear (common bugs), SIM: simplify, ANN: annotations
```

---

## Type Checking

Linting and type checking catch different things. Run both.

**TypeScript:**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # type check without emitting files
```

**Python:**

```bash
mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports
# or
pyright src/
```

**Required compiler options (TypeScript):**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true, // enables all strict checks
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true, // index access can be undefined
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

---

## Pre-commit Integration

Run linting automatically before every commit:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace

  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        name: ESLint
        language: node
        entry: npx eslint --ext .ts,.tsx
        types: [javascript, ts]

      - id: tsc
        name: TypeScript
        language: node
        entry: npx tsc --noEmit
        pass_filenames: false
```

## Scripts

| Script                     | Purpose                                   | Run With                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `scripts/lint_runner.py`   | Runs project linting and reports findings | `python scripts/lint_runner.py <project_path>`   |
| `scripts/type_coverage.py` | Measures TypeScript type coverage         | `python scripts/type_coverage.py <project_path>` |

## Output Format

When this skill produces or reviews code, structure your output as follows:

```
━━━ Lint And Validate Report ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Skill:       Lint And Validate
Language:    [detected language / framework]
Scope:       [N files · N functions]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Passed:   [checks that passed, or "All clean"]
⚠️  Warnings: [non-blocking issues, or "None"]
❌ Blocked:  [blocking issues requiring fix, or "None"]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
VBC status:  PENDING → VERIFIED
Evidence:    [test output / lint pass / compile success]
```

**VBC (Verification-Before-Completion) is mandatory.**
Do not mark status as VERIFIED until concrete terminal evidence is provided.

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

---

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
