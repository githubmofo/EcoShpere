## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Adding `role='button'` to a `<div>` instead of using `<button>` -> ✅ Native HTML elements have built-in keyboard and screen reader support
- ❌ Using `aria-label` on elements that already have visible text -> ✅ Redundant ARIA overrides visible text for screen readers; use only when needed
- ❌ Color as the only indicator of state -> ✅ Always pair color with icon, text, or pattern for colorblind users (1 in 12 males)
- ❌ Assuming accessibility is a checklist to run at the end -> ✅ Build accessible from the start; retrofitting is 10x more expensive

# Web Accessibility (a11y) — Inclusive UI Mastery

---

## 1. Semantic HTML over `<div>` Soup

The first rule of ARIA: **Use native HTML elements whenever possible.**

```html
<!-- ❌ BAD: Meaningless markup, screen readers see nothing, no keyboard focus -->
<div class="submit-button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- ✅ GOOD: Native semantic element (inherits focus, Enter/Space key behavior) -->
<button type="submit" class="button">Submit</button>

<!-- ❌ BAD: Div as a link -->
<div onclick="goToPath('/about')">About Us</div>

<!-- ✅ GOOD: Native anchor -->
<a href="/about">About Us</a>
```

### Layout Semantics

Replace `<div class="x">` with meaning:

- `<header>` / `<footer>`
- `<nav>` (Main navigations)
- `<main>` (The primary content)
- `<article>` (Self-contained content blocks)
- `<aside>` (Sidebars, callouts)

---

## 2. Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management

Every interactive element MUST be keyboard accessible.

```css
/* ❌ BAD: Removing focus outlines ruins keyboard navigation */
*:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* ✅ GOOD: Using :focus-visible for keyboard users only */
*:focus {
  outline: none;
} /* Hide for click */
*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--accent-color);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Managing Focus in Modals (Dialogs)

When a modal opens:

1. Focus must move into the modal (first focusable element).
2. Focus must be trapped inside the modal (Tabbing loops inside it).
3. Background must be hidden from screen readers (`aria-hidden="true"`).
4. `Escape` key must close it.
5. When closed, focus returns to the button that opened it.

```html
<!-- ✅ BEST: Use the native <dialog> element. It handles focus trapping automatically! -->
<dialog id="myModal">
  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <button formmethod="dialog">Close</button>
</dialog>
<script>
  document.getElementById("myModal").showModal();
</script>
```

---

## 3. ARIA Roles & Attributes

When you build complex custom widgets (like tabs or accordions), you must apply ARIA attributes to tell screen readers what it is and what state it's in.

```html
<!-- Example: Custom Accordion/Disclosure -->
<!-- ❌ BAD: Screen reader sees plain text, doesn't know it's expandable -->
<div class="accordion">
  <div class="header">Advanced Settings</div>
  <div class="content" style="display: none;">...</div>
</div>

<!-- ✅ GOOD: ARIA provides context -->
<div class="accordion">
  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="panel-id" id="header-id">Advanced Settings</button>
  <div id="panel-id" role="region" aria-labelledby="header-id" hidden>...</div>
</div>
```

**Crucial ARIA states:**

- `aria-expanded="true/false"`: For accordions, dropdowns, menus.
- `aria-hidden="true"`: Removes decorative icons/containers from the screen reader tree.
- `aria-pressed="true/false"`: For toggle buttons.
- `aria-invalid="true"`: For invalid form fields.

---

## 4. Forms & Labels

**Every input must have an associated label.** `placeholder` is NOT a label (it disappears when typing, causing cognitive loss).

```html
<!-- ❌ BAD -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Email Address">

<!-- ✅ GOOD: Explicit linking via id/for -->
<label for="email">Email Address</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">

<!-- ✅ GOOD: Implicit wrapping -->
<label>
  Email Address
  <input type="email" name="email">
</label>

<!-- Accessible Error Messages -->
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  aria-invalid="true"
  aria-describedby="username-error"

<span id="username-error" role="alert" class="error-msg">Username is already taken</span>
```

---

## 5. Live Regions (Dynamic Updates)

When content changes dynamically without a page reload (e.g., Toast notifications, AI responding, search results updating), the screen reader needs to be notified.

```html
<!-- 
  role="alert": Interrupts the user immediately (e.g., error).
  role="status" (or aria-live="polite"): Waits until the user pauses, then announces.
-->
<div aria-live="polite" class="sr-only">
  <!-- JavaScript injects: "3 items found" here, screen reader reads it aloud -->
</div>
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
