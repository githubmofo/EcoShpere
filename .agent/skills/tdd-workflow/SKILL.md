## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Writing tests that test implementation details instead of behavior -> ✅ Test WHAT it does (inputs/outputs), not HOW (internal methods)
- ❌ Skipping the Red phase (writing a failing test first) -> ✅ If the test passes before you write the code, it tests nothing
- ❌ Refactoring during the Red or Green phase -> ✅ Red: write failing test. Green: make it pass minimally. THEN refactor. Never mix phases

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) — Defect-Free Execution Mastery

---

## 1. The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

TDD is a strict, irrevocable discipline. Do not write the implementation first.

### Step 1: RED (Write the failing test)

Write the test as if the API already exists exactly how you _wish_ it were designed.
Run the test. It MUST fail (because the function doesn't exist, or returns the wrong value). If it passes, the test is useless.

```typescript
// 1. The failing test
import { calculateDiscount } from "./pricing";

test("Should apply 10% discount for orders over $100", () => {
  expect(calculateDiscount(150)).toBe(135);
});
// ❌ FAILS: calculateDiscount is not defined
```

### Step 2: GREEN (Make it pass exactly)

Write the absolute minimum, dumbest code required to make the test pass. Do not over-engineer.

```typescript
// 2. The minimum implementation
export function calculateDiscount(subtotal: number): number {
  if (subtotal >= 100) return subtotal * 0.9;
  return subtotal;
}
// ✅ PASSES.
```

### Step 3: REFACTOR

Now wrap the implementation in clean architectural principles. The tests guarantee you haven't broken the behavior while you optimize.

```typescript
// 3. The Refactor
const DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD = 100;
const DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.9;

export function calculateDiscount(subtotal: number): number {
  return subtotal >= DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD ? subtotal * DISCOUNT_RATE : subtotal;
}
// ✅ STILL PASSES. Safe to commit.
```

## 2. Test Doubles (Mocks, Stubs, Spies)

Knowing _how_ to mock separates amateurs from professionals. Over-mocking destroys architectural integrity.

| Type      | When to use                                          | Example                                                  |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dummy** | Filler objects passed but never used                 | `processOrder(new UserDummy(), payload)`                 |
| **Stub**  | Hardcodes a specific response                        | `db.getUser.mockResolvedValue({ id: 1 })`                |
| **Spy**   | Records how many times a function was called         | `expect(emailService.send).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)`     |
| **Mock**  | A spy with predefined expectations of exact payloads | `expect(logger.info).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Authorized')` |

### The Mocking Rule

**Only mock at the architectural boundaries (Database, Network, External FileSystem).**
NEVER mock internal business logic or child pure-functions. If function A calls function B, test A by allowing it to genuinely call B.

---

## 3. Anti-Pattern: Testing Implementation Details

Tests should verify the _behavior_ output, not the underlying code structure.

```typescript
class Account {
  private balance = 0;
  deposit(amount: number) {
    this.balance += amount;
  }
  getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }
}

// ❌ BAD: Testing internal state (Fragile)
test("Deposit updates the internal balance variable", () => {
  const acc = new Account();
  acc.deposit(50);
  expect(acc["balance"]).toBe(50); // Intrusive test breaks if variable is renamed
});

// ✅ GOOD: Testing external behavior contract
test("Deposit makes the funds available via getBalance", () => {
  const acc = new Account();
  acc.deposit(50);
  expect(acc.getBalance()).toBe(50); // Tests the public API only
});
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
