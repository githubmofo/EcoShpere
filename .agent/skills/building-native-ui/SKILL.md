## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ `SafeAreaView` wrapping everything -> ✅ Use `SafeAreaProvider` + `useSafeAreaInsets()` for granular control
- ❌ Using `ScrollView` for long lists -> ✅ `FlatList` or `FlashList` for virtualized rendering; ScrollView renders ALL items
- ❌ `Dimensions.get('window')` for responsive layouts -> ✅ Use `useWindowDimensions()` hook (reactive to rotation/resize)
- ❌ Animating with `Animated.timing` by default -> ✅ Use `Reanimated 3` with `useSharedValue` for 120fps worklet-based animations

# Building Native UI — React Native & Expo Mastery

A mobile app isn't a website confined to a small screen.
60 FPS is not a goal; it is a rigid requirement. The JS thread is a fragile bottleneck.

---

## 1. The Expo Router Architecture

File-based routing replaces legacy imperative React Navigation boilerplates.

```typescript
// Directory structure dictates routes
// app/
// ├── _layout.tsx      (Global wrap, e.g. Stack or Tabs)
// ├── index.tsx        (Matches '/')
// ├── (auth)/          (Route group, invisible in URL)
// │   └── login.tsx    (Matches '/login')
// └── user/
//     └── [id].tsx     (Dynamic route, matches '/user/123')

// Link navigation (Strongly typed in Expo Router v3+)
import { Link, router } from 'expo-router';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <View>
      {/* Declarative */}
      <Link href="/user/123" asChild>
        <Pressable><Text>Go to Profile</Text></Pressable>
      </Link>

      {/* Imperative */}
      <Button onPress={() => router.push('/(auth)/login')} title="Login" />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## 2. Platform Nuances & Safe Areas

Mobile devices have notches, home indicators, and varied status bars.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Ignoring notches
export const Header = () => <View style={{ paddingTop: 20 }} />

// ✅ GOOD: react-native-safe-area-context
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export const Header = () => {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();
  return (
    <View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top, paddingBottom: insets.bottom }}>
      <Text>Header Content</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// ✅ Platform-specific logic
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  shadow: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: { shadowColor: '#000', shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 }, shadowOpacity: 0.2 },
      android: { elevation: 4 }, // Android requires elevation for shadows
    }),
  }
});
```

---

## 3. High-Performance Animations (Reanimated)

Never animate over the React Native bridge. Keep animations strictly on the native UI thread using `react-native-reanimated`.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Animated.Value across the bridge, or setState driven animations
// setState -> JS Thread calculate -> Bridge JSON -> Native UI (Drops frames!)

// ✅ GOOD: Reanimated UI thread execution
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';

export function BouncyBox() {
  const offset = useSharedValue(0); // Lives natively

  const animatedStyles = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
    return {
      transform: [{ translateY: offset.value }], // Syncs natively
    };
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.box, animatedStyles]} />
      <Button onPress={() => (offset.value = withSpring(Math.random() * 255))} title="Bounce" />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## 4. List Performance

FlatList rendering is the #1 cause of React Native app crashes due to OOM (Out of Memory).

```typescript
import { FlashList } from "@shopify/flash-list";

// ❌ BAD: Standard ScrollView for massive lists
// Maps every item instantly. Crashes on large data sets.

// ❌ MEDIOCRE: FlatList
// Blank spaces when scrolling fast due to JS thread bridge bottlenecks.

// ✅ BEST: FlashList (Shopify)
// Recycles views instantly like native UICollectionView / RecyclerView.
export function FastList({ data }) {
  return (
    <FlashList
      data={data}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.title}</Text>}
      estimatedItemSize={50} // CRUCIAL for performance
    />
  );
}
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
