## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Writing plans without verification criteria -> ✅ Every plan needs a 'How to verify this worked' section
- ❌ Planning at the wrong granularity (too high or too low) -> ✅ Plans should be at the component/feature level, not line-by-line or system-wide
- ❌ Skipping the 'What could go wrong' section -> ✅ Identifying failure modes before implementation prevents costly rework

# Plan Writing — Execution Blueprints Mastery

---

## 1. The Implementation Plan Structure (ADR-Lite)

Before altering multiple files or introducing a new system architecture, a rigid `implementation_plan.md` MUST be generated and approved.

**Core Sections:**

1. **Objective Context:** 2-sentence summary of the requested goal.
2. **Architectural Handoff:** (What stack, what libraries, what constraints).
3. **Dependency Tree Execution Order:** (Cannot build frontend UI until backend API exists).
4. **File Blueprint:** Exact files expected to be touched (`[NEW] src/api/user.ts`, `[MODIFY] src/db/schema.prisma`).
5. **Verification Protocol:** Exactly how the agent/human will prove the task is completed successfully.

---

## 2. Segmenting Monolithic Tasks (Chunking)

LLMs degrade significantly when asked to process >10 file alterations across multiple directories simultaneously. The Plan Writer must break work into logical, isolated "Waves."

```markdown
### Wave 1: Data Layer (The Foundation)

1. Add `Subscription` model to Prisma schema.
2. Generate migration (`npx prisma migrate dev`).
3. Add mock seed data.

### Wave 2: API Layer (The Bridge)

1. Build `/api/subscriptions/route.ts` with explicit Zod validation.
2. Write Vitest logic enforcing authorization roles.

### Wave 3: UI Layer (The Implementation)

1. Build `SubscriptionCard.tsx`.
2. Connect to API using MSW mocked tests first.
3. Integrate into main dashboard.
```

_Crucial:_ Each wave MUST be executable and testable independently. Do not begin Wave 2 until Wave 1 passes Verification Protocols.

---

## 3. Rollback & Contingency Planning

No plan survives first contact with the compiler. The plan must implicitly include safe-fail procedures.

- **Non-Destructive Defaults:** If a schema migration fails, how do we revert? (e.g., explicit instruction to backup SQLite DB locally before operations).
- **Graceful Feature Toggles:** Is the new feature walled behind an environment variable (`ENABLE_NEW_DASHBOARD=true`) so it can be disabled instantly if it crashes in production?

---

## 4. The `task.md` Execution Ledger

Unlike the high-level `implementation_plan.md`, the `task.md` serves as the live, mutating execution state.

```markdown
# Current Objective: Upgrade Authentication

## Pre-Flight

- [x] Dump existing environment variables locally
- [x] Verify current tests pass (Baseline health)

## Wave 1 (OAuth Scaffold)

- [/] Install auth.js dependencies
- [ ] Connect Google Provider inside `[...nextauth].ts`

## Wave 2 (Database Mappings)

- [ ] Update Users table to handle polymorphic OAuth links
```

_Rules:_

- `[ ]` = Unstarted
- `[/]` = In Progress (Current Focus)
- `[x]` = Verified Complete

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
