## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Importing Node.js-only APIs (fs, net, child_process) in edge functions -> ✅ Edge runtime has NO Node.js APIs; use Web APIs only
- ❌ Using `global` or module-level mutable state in edge -> ✅ Edge functions are stateless across requests; use KV/Durable Objects for state
- ❌ Assuming edge functions have unlimited execution time -> ✅ Cloudflare Workers: 30s, Vercel Edge: 25s; design for millisecond responses

# Edge Computing — Global Latency Mastery

---

## 1. The Edge Model (V8 Isolates vs Node.js)

Edge functions (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge) run on V8 Isolates, NOT standard Node.js environments.

**What This Means:**

1. Extremely fast cold starts (< 5ms) because there is no underlying OS process bootup.
2. Hard memory/time limits per request (e.g., 50ms CPU time max).
3. **NO NATIVE NODE MODULES.** You cannot use `fs`, `child_process`, or heavy native C++ binaries (e.g., standard `bcrypt`, `sharp`).

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Attempting to use Node native core modules
import fs from "fs";
import bcrypt from "bcrypt"; // Has C++ bindings, will instantly crash on V8 edge

// ✅ GOOD: Utilizing standard Web APIs (Fetch, CryptoKey)
const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", new TextEncoder().encode(password));
```

---

## 2. Advanced Route Caching (Stale-While-Revalidate)

The highest value proposition of the edge is intercepting requests _before_ they cross the ocean.

```typescript
// Standard Edge Proxy request handling
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    // 1. Cache API responses at the edge
    const cache = caches.default;
    let response = await cache.match(request);

    if (!response) {
      // 2. Fetch Origin (The real server in Virginia)
      response = await fetch(request);

      // 3. Mutate Headers for SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)
      // Instructs the Edge CDN: Serve the stale version instantly to the user,
      // but fire an async request in the background to update the cache for the next user.
      response = new Response(response.body, response);
      response.headers.set("Cache-Control", "s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=86400");

      // 4. Store in Cache asynchronously (do not block the user response)
      ctx.waitUntil(cache.put(request, response.clone()));
    }

    return response;
  },
};
```

## 3. Edge Data Locality (The Database Problem)

Running logic globally while querying a monolithic database in `us-east-1` is counter-productive. The latency of establishing a connection across the Atlantic will negate any Edge benefits.

### Solutions:

1. **Edge KV Stores**: (Cloudflare KV, Vercel KV) Eventually consistent, highly localized read-latency configs suitable for configuration routing, user sessions, or feature flags.
2. **Distributed SQLite**: (Cloudflare D1, Turso) Replicas distributed to edge nodes automatically.
3. **Connection Pooling**: Use an HTTP/Connection Pool proxy strictly (e.g., Prisma Accelerate, Supabase Edge Pooler). You cannot establish TCP `pg://` connections directly from millions of spinning V8 isolates, you will OOM crash the database.

```typescript
// ✅ Turso / LibSQL (Distributed Edge DB) usage:
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client/web";

const client = createClient({
  url: env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

const result = await client.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId]);
```

---

## 4. WebSockets at the Edge (Durable Objects)

Standard Edge functions are stateless. To hold persistent state (like a live multiplayer gaming room, or a chat room's WebSocket connections across multiple users), you must funnel those connections into a single point of state: a Durable Object.

```typescript
// A Durable Object serves as a single source of truth that users globally connect into
export class ChatRoom {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
    this.sessions = [];
  }

  async fetch(request) {
    // Upgrade standard HTTP to WebSocket
    const pair = new WebSocketPair();

    // Accept connection, store it globally
    this.sessions.push(pair.server);
    pair.server.accept();

    // Handle incoming Chat messages
    pair.server.addEventListener("message", (msg) => {
      // Broadcast to all other connected edge users
      this.sessions.forEach((session) => session.send(msg.data));
    });

    return new Response(null, { status: 101, webSocket: pair.client });
  }
}
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
