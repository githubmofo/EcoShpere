## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Using `<div>` for everything instead of semantic HTML -> ✅ Use `<main>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>` for crawler comprehension
- ❌ Multiple `<h1>` tags on a single page -> ✅ One `<h1>` per page; use `<h2>`-`<h6>` for hierarchy
- ❌ Generating meta descriptions with AI boilerplate -> ✅ Each page needs a unique, specific meta description under 160 characters
- ❌ Using client-side rendering for content pages -> ✅ SSR/SSG for pages that need to be indexed; CSR is invisible to crawlers without JS rendering

# SEO Fundamentals — Visibility & Discoverability Mastery

---

## 1. Core Meta Architecture (The Next.js 15 Standard)

Do not use legacy `next/head` tags scattered across components. Use the built-in Metadata API explicitly.

```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import { Metadata } from "next";

export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const post = await fetchPost(params.slug);

  return {
    title: `${post.title} | MyBrand`,
    description: post.excerpt,
    keywords: post.tags,
    alternates: {
      canonical: `https://www.example.com/blog/${params.slug}`,
    },
    openGraph: {
      title: post.title,
      description: post.excerpt,
      type: "article",
      url: `https://example.com/blog/${params.slug}`,
      images: [{ url: post.coverImageUrl, width: 1200, height: 630 }],
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image", // Critical for big Twitter link previews
    },
  };
}
```

---

## 2. Semantic HTML & Heading Hierarchy

Google establishes context by parsing the DOM outline. A massive application constructed purely of `<div className="text-xl font-bold">` tags will be heavily penalized.

1. **The H1 Law:** Exactly ONE `<h1>` per page. This is the primary subject.
2. **Hierarchy Integrity:** Never skip heading levels. An `<h2>` MUST precede an `<h3>`. Do not use heading tags for visual sizing; use them purely for document structure.
3. **Semantic Tags:** Wrap headers in `<header>`, menus in `<nav>`, main content in `<main>`, and sidebars in `<aside>`.

```html
<!-- ✅ GOOD: Perfect SEO Document Outline -->
<main>
  <article>
    <h1>The Future of AI Agents</h1>
    <p>Introduction...</p>

    <h2>Architectural Patterns</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>The Supervisor Pattern</h3>
      <p>Content regarding supervisors...</p>
    </section>
  </article>
</main>
```

---

## 3. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Help search engines understand exact data graphs (Products, Reviews, Articles, Jobs) bypassingly standard text crawling. Inject standard `Schema.org` JSON-LD.

```typescript
// Injecting JSON-LD structurally into a React/Next component
export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  const jsonLd = {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'Product',
    name: product.name,
    image: product.image,
    description: product.description,
    offers: {
      '@type': 'Offer',
      price: product.price,
      priceCurrency: 'USD',
      availability: product.inStock ? 'https://schema.org/InStock' : 'https://schema.org/OutOfStock',
    },
  };

  return (
    <section>
      {/* Script injected cleanly into DOM */}
      <script
        type="application/ld+json"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}
      />

      <h1>{product.name}</h1>
      {/* ... rest of UI ... */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

## 4. Robots & Sitemaps

If a page shouldn't be indexed (e.g., dynamic search result matrices, user profiles), you must explicitly block it, otherwise Googlebot wastes "Crawl Budget" on infinite URLs.

- **`robots.txt`**: Denies crawling of specific directories.
- **`<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`**: Denies indexing of a specific page instance.
- **`sitemap.xml`**: A programmatic manifest mapped to root guiding crawlers mathematically through all valid indexable paths.

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
