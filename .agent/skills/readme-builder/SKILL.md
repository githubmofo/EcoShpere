## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Starting a README with the project name as the only heading -> ✅ Lead with what the project DOES, not just what it IS
- ❌ Skipping installation and quick-start sections -> ✅ Users need to run the project in under 60 seconds or they leave
- ❌ Using screenshots without alt text -> ✅ All images need descriptive alt text for accessibility and broken image fallback

# README Builder Skill

---

## Ground Rules

1. **Always scan the project first** — read `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, source files before writing a single line
2. **No placeholder content** — every section must have real, specific information
3. **Lead with value** — the first 3 lines must communicate what the project does and who it's for
4. **Runnable examples** — every code block must be copy-paste ready and tested against the actual project

---

## Discovery Phase (Mandatory Before Writing)

Before generating any README content, answer these questions by scanning the project:

```
1. What does this project do? (single sentence)
2. Who is the target user? (developer / end-user / enterprise)
3. What problem does it solve?
4. What are the installation prerequisites?
5. What is the primary command or API entry point?
6. Does it have a license file?
7. Are there screenshots, demos, or GIFs available?
8. Is there a CONTRIBUTING.md or CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md?
9. What CI/CD badges are relevant? (GitHub Actions, npm, PyPI, etc.)
10. What is the current version?
```

````

---

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Example

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Option    | Type      | Default     | Description      |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `option1` | `string`  | `"default"` | What it controls |
| `option2` | `boolean` | `false`     | What it controls |

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: add your feature"`
4. Push to branch: `git push origin feat/your-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Section Writing Guidelines

### Hero Section (Lines 1–5)

- Project name as `# H1` — only one per README
- Tagline in a `> blockquote` — punchy, one sentence
- Badges immediately after — visual trust signals

### Features Section

- Use emoji bullets for scannability
- Each bullet = one concrete capability, not a vague claim
- ❌ "Powerful and flexible" → ✅ "Processes 10k records/sec with zero config"

### Installation Section

- Always show the most direct path first (e.g., `npm install`)
- Show alternatives (yarn, pnpm, brew) as secondary options
- If there are post-install steps (env vars, migrations), list them explicitly

### Usage Section

- Start with the simplest 1-line example
- Progress to realistic examples with real flag names
- If it's a library, show import + function call pattern

### Configuration Table

- Every environment variable or config key goes here
- Include: name, type, default, description
- Mark required fields with `*` in the Description column

---

## Project-Type Specific Additions

### CLI Tools

Add a dedicated `## Commands` section:

```markdown
## Commands

| Command       | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `tool init`   | Initialize a new project   |
| `tool build`  | Compile and bundle         |
| `tool deploy` | Deploy to production       |
| `tool --help` | Show all available options |
```

### Libraries / SDKs

Add a `## API Reference` section with function signatures:

```markdown
## API Reference

### `functionName(param1, param2)`

Returns: `ReturnType`

| Parameter | Type      | Description     |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| `param1`  | `string`  | Description     |
| `param2`  | `options` | Optional config |
```

### Monorepos

Add a `## Packages` table:

```markdown
## Packages

| Package                      | Version                                                                    | Description   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [`@org/core`](packages/core) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@org/core)](https://npm.im/@org/core) | Core engine   |
| [`@org/cli`](packages/cli)   | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@org/cli)](https://npm.im/@org/cli)   | CLI interface |
```

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

**Slash command: `/review` or `/tribunal-full`**
**Active reviewers: `logic-reviewer` · `security-auditor`**

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
