## Hallucination Traps (Read First)

- ❌ Running database migrations and code deploy in the same step -> ✅ Migrate FIRST, deploy code SECOND (expand-and-contract)
- ❌ Deploying without a rollback plan -> ✅ Every deploy needs a tested rollback: previous Docker image tag or git revert
- ❌ Using `latest` tags in production container images -> ✅ Always use specific version tags or SHA digests

# Deployment Procedures — Production Execution Mastery

---

## 1. Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

Stopping a server, pulling code, building, and restarting is unacceptable. This results in 30-120 seconds of 502 Bad Gateway errors.

### Blue/Green Deployment

- Two identical environments (Blue is live, Green is idle).
- Deploy v2 to Green. Run smoke tests on Green.
- Swap the reverse proxy (Nginx or Load Balancer) router from Blue to Green.
- Zero downtime. Rollback is instant (swap router back to Blue).

### Rolling Updates (Container Clusters)

- If you have 5 containers running v1.
- Spin up 1 container running v2. Wait for it to pass health checks.
- Drain and terminate 1 container of v1.
- Repeat until all 5 containers run v2.

```bash
# Docker Swarm / ECS / Kubernetes inherently handle rolling updates
docker service update --image myapp:v2 --update-parallelism 1 --update-delay 10s myapp_web
```

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) CI Pipelines

All deployment logic must be codified and checked in alongside the application code.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Production Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

# Concurrency limits prevent race conditions if two commits are pushed rapidly
concurrency:
  group: production-deploy
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1. CI Phase: Fast fail
      - name: Install & Audit
        run: npm ci && npm audit --audit-level=high

      - name: Unit Tests
        run: npm test

      # 2. Build Phase
      - name: Build Assets
        run: npm run build

      # 3. CD Phase (Deployment via SSH/Docker)
      - name: Deploy to Server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          username: deploy_user
          key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd /opt/myapp
            git pull origin main
            docker-compose up -d --build
            # Container starts in background, port mapped to Nginx.
```

## 3. Database Migration Safety Rules

Schema changes cause 90% of severe deployment outages.

**The Expand-and-Contract Pattern (Zero Downtime DB Migrations):**
Never drop columns or rename tables on a live system. Old code running against new schemas _will_ crash.

_Goal: Rename column `first_name` to `given_name`_

- **Phase 1 (Expand):** Add `given_name` as a NEW, nullable column. The app writes to BOTH columns simultaneously, reads from `first_name`.
- **Phase 2 (Migrate):** Run background script copying `first_name` data to `given_name`.
- **Phase 3 (Swap):** Deploy v2 Application code that reads/writes exclusively to `given_name`.
- **Phase 4 (Contract):** Drop the legacy `first_name` column weeks later.

---

## 4. The 5-Minute Rollback Guarantee

If the new deployment throws persistent 5xx errors, how fast can you revert?
If the answer relies on "recompiling the old git commit," you have failed.

1. **Docker Tags:** Every build is tagged with the Git SHA (`myapp:a1b2c3d`). Reverting is a split-second container swap.
2. **Feature Flags:** The code deployed completely dormant. If it breaks when toggled via flag, the rollback is hitting the "Off" button on LaunchDarkly (Zero code deployed).
3. **Database Integrity:** Migrations are explicitly atomic (`BEGIN; DROP TABLE...; COMMIT;`) so failures roll back seamlessly.

AI coding assistants often fall into specific bad habits when dealing with this domain. These are strictly forbidden:

1. **Over-engineering:** Proposing complex abstractions or distributed systems when a simpler approach suffices.
2. **Hallucinated Libraries/Methods:** Using non-existent methods or packages. Always `// VERIFY` or check `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
3. **Skipping Edge Cases:** Writing the "happy path" and ignoring error handling, timeouts, or data validation.
4. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.
5. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or re-raising.

### ❌ Forbidden AI Tropes

1. **Blind Assumptions:** Never make an assumption without documenting it clearly with `// VERIFY: [reason]`.
2. **Silent Degradation:** Catching and suppressing errors without logging or handling.
3. **Context Amnesia:** Forgetting the user's constraints and offering generic advice instead of tailored solutions.

Review these questions before confirming output:

```
✅ Did I rely ONLY on real, verified tools and methods?
✅ Is this solution appropriately scoped to the user's constraints?
✅ Did I handle potential failure modes and edge cases?
✅ Have I avoided generic boilerplate that doesn't add value?
```

### 🛑 Verification-Before-Completion (VBC) Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You must follow a strict "evidence-based closeout" state machine.

- ❌ **Forbidden:** Declaring a task complete because the output "looks correct."
- ✅ **Required:** You are explicitly forbidden from finalizing any task without providing **concrete evidence** (terminal output, passing tests, compile success, or equivalent proof) that your output works as intended.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
