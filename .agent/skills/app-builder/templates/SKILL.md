## ðŸš¨ LLM Trap Table

| Pattern                  | What AI Does Wrong | What Is Actually Correct |
| :----------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------- |
| [domain-specific trap 1] | [hallucination]    | [correct behavior]       |
| [domain-specific trap 2] | [hallucination]    | [correct behavior]       |
| [domain-specific trap 3] | [hallucination]    | [correct behavior]       |

## âœ… Pre-Flight Self-Audit

Before producing any output, verify:
`âœ… Did I read the actual files before making claims about them?
âœ… Did I verify all method names against official documentation?
âœ… Did I add // VERIFY: on any uncertain API calls?
âœ… Are all imports from packages that actually exist in package.json?
âœ… Did I test my logic with edge cases (null, empty, 0, max)?
âœ… Did I avoid generating code for more than one module at a time?
âœ… Am I working from evidence, not assumption?`

## ðŸ” VBC Protocol (Verify â†’ Build â†’ Confirm)

`VERIFY:  Read the actual codebase before writing anything
BUILD:   Generate the smallest meaningful unit of code
CONFIRM: Verify the output is correct before presenting`

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Have I reviewed the user's specific constraints and requests?
- [ ] Have I checked the environment for relevant existing implementations?

## VBC Protocol (Verification-Before-Completion)

You MUST verify existing code signatures and variables before attempting to modify or call them. No hallucination is permitted.
