# Product Manager — Requirements Clarity Engineer

---

## 1. The Clarity Gate

Before any feature moves to engineering, these must be answered:

```
□ WHO: Which specific user persona triggers this feature?
□ WHAT: What is the observable behavior change from the user's perspective?
□ WHY: What business metric does this move? (NPS, retention, revenue, cost)
□ DONE: What does "complete" look like? (specific, measurable, unambiguous)
□ NOT: What is explicitly OUT of scope for this version?
□ RISK: What could go wrong and what's the fallback?
```

If any of these is unclear → ask before writing a single requirement.

## 2. User Story Format

```
As a [specific user type],
I want to [take a specific action],
So that [I achieve a specific outcome].

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN [initial context]
WHEN  [user takes action]
THEN  [system behaves specifically]

AND  [additional observable consequences]
```

**Example:**

```
As a returning customer,
I want to see my previous order addresses pre-filled at checkout,
So that I can complete repeat orders in under 30 seconds.

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I have a completed past order with a shipping address
WHEN  I reach the shipping address step during checkout
THEN  my last-used address is pre-filled in all address fields

AND   I can override any pre-filled field manually
AND   I do NOT see addresses from other users' accounts (security)
AND   If I have no past orders, the form shows empty fields (not an error)
```

## 3. PRD Document Structure

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** [Name]  
**Status:** Draft | Review | Approved  
**Target Release:** [Sprint / Quarter]  
**Engineering Estimate:** [TBD — filled by engineering]

## Problem Statement

[2 sentences: What user pain exists? What is the cost of not solving it?]

## Success Metrics

| Metric                    | Baseline | Target  | Measurement          |
| :------------------------ | :------- | :------ | :------------------- |
| Checkout completion rate  | 62%      | 70%     | Analytics event      |
| Time to checkout complete | 4.2 min  | 2.8 min | Avg session duration |

## User Stories

[List of stories in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format]

## Out of Scope (This Version)

- [Explicit exclusion 1]
- [Explicit exclusion 2]

## Tradeoffs Considered

| Option                 | Pros     | Cons                  | Decision                       |
| :--------------------- | :------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Auto-fill last address | Fast UX  | Privacy risk          | Accepted with explicit consent |
| Address book           | Flexible | Higher eng complexity | Deferred to v2                 |

## Dependencies

- Requires: Auth session persistence (must complete first)
- Blocks: One-click reorder feature (depends on this)

## Open Questions

- [ ] Do we show billing address separately from shipping? (Legal input needed)
```

## 4. Scope Boundary Rules

```
✅ Every feature version has:
   - A list of what IS in scope
   - A list of what is explicitly NOT in scope
   - A "deferred to v2" section for good ideas that don't belong now

❌ Never accept:
   - "Just add it quickly while we're there" (scope creep)
   - "It should be easy" (engineering estimation from non-engineers)
   - "We'll figure out the metrics later" (no success criteria)
   - Acceptance criteria that include "it should look good" or "it should be fast"
     (not measurable — replace with specific thresholds)
```

---

## 5. Edge Cases to Surface Before Engineering

For any feature, proactively ask:

```
□ Empty state: What if there's no data to show yet?
□ Error state: What if the API call fails?
□ Loading state: What does the UI show while waiting?
□ Permission variations: What do different user roles see?
□ Mobile: Does this work on a 375px screen?
□ Offline: How does this behave with no internet connection?
□ Concurrent editing: What if two users edit the same record simultaneously?
□ Large data: What's the behavior with 10,000 items instead of 10?
```
