# Documentation Writer — Context Preservation Engineer

## 1. The Documentation Hierarchy

```
Level 1 — Why (ADRs):    Why was this architectural decision made?
Level 2 — How (README):  How do I set this up and use it?
Level 3 — What (JSDoc):  What does this function do, accept, and return?
Level 4 — Detail (inline): What is non-obvious about this specific line?
```

---

## 2. JSDoc API Documentation

Every exported function must be documented. Private helpers: document only if non-obvious.

````typescript
/**
 * Calculates the discounted price for an order.
 *
 * Applies a 10% discount to orders over $100. The discount boundary
 * is exclusive — a $100 order receives no discount.
 *
 * @param orderTotal - The pre-discount total in USD cents (not dollars)
 * @returns The final price after discount in USD cents
 * @throws {RangeError} If orderTotal is negative
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * calculateDiscount(15000) // $150.00 → returns 13500 ($135.00)
 * calculateDiscount(10000) // $100.00 → returns 10000 (no discount)
 * calculateDiscount(-100)  // throws RangeError
 * ```
 */
export function calculateDiscount(orderTotal: number): number {
  if (orderTotal < 0) throw new RangeError(`orderTotal cannot be negative: ${orderTotal}`);
  return orderTotal > 10000 ? Math.floor(orderTotal * 0.9) : orderTotal;
}

/**
 * Retrieves a user by their ID with their published posts.
 * Returns null if the user does not exist or has been soft-deleted.
 *
 * @param userId - CUID2 user identifier
 * @param options - Query options
 * @param options.includePosts - Whether to include published posts (default: false)
 */
export async function getUser(
  userId: string,
  options: { includePosts?: boolean } = {}
): Promise<User | null> { ... }

## 3. Inline Comments — What to Comment and What Not To

```typescript
// ❌ USELESS: Restates what the code obviously does
const total = price + tax; // Add price and tax to get total

// ❌ USELESS: Variable name already explains it
const userId = session.user.id; // Get the user ID

// ✅ VALUABLE: Explains why a non-obvious decision was made
// Using bcrypt cost factor 12: 11 is 350ms, 13 is 1400ms at current hardware.
// 12 balances security and server response time.
const BCRYPT_ROUNDS = 12;

// ✅ VALUABLE: Documents a known workaround
// Prisma client requires singleton pattern in development to avoid
// connection pool exhaustion during hot-reload. See: prisma.io/docs/guides/nextjs
const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };
```

## 5. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document WHY a significant technical decision was made — the context that disappears from git history.

```markdown
# ADR-003: Use Prisma Instead of Drizzle

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Deciders:** Engineering Team

## Context
We need an ORM for PostgreSQL. Two viable options: Prisma 6 and Drizzle ORM.

## Decision
We chose **Prisma 6**.

## Rationale
- Team has existing Prisma experience — shorter ramp-up
- Prisma Studio provides visual DB browser for non-engineers
- Prisma's migration system handles complex schema evolution cases
- Drizzle offers better raw query performance but our query patterns don't require it

## Tradeoffs Accepted
- Prisma is slower for raw high-frequency writes (< Drizzle by ~20%)
- Prisma generates heavier client bundle (not an issue — server-only)

## Consequences
All DB access uses Prisma. If we exceed 50k writes/minute, re-evaluate.

## 6. OpenAPI 3.1 Route Documentation

```yaml
# For REST APIs, every route needs an OpenAPI spec block
paths:
  /api/users/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get user by ID
      operationId: getUserById
      tags: [Users]
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          description: CUID2 user identifier
          schema:
            type: string
            pattern: "^[a-z0-9]{24,}$"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
        "404":
          description: User not found or deleted
        "401":
          description: Not authenticated
```
