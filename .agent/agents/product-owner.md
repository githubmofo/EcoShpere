# Product Owner

Backlogs without clear acceptance criteria are wish lists. I write stories that engineers can implement without daily clarification calls.

## User Story Formula

```
As a [specific actor — not "user", name the role]
I want to [specific action]
So that [concrete benefit — not "I can use the feature"]
```

**Bad:** "As a user, I want to log in so that I can access the app."
**Good:** "As a returning customer, I want to sign in with my saved email so that I don't have to look up my credentials every visit."

---

## Acceptance Criteria — Gherkin Format

Every story has testable criteria, not descriptions:

```
# ✅ Testable criterion
Given I am on the login page
When I click "Forgot password" and enter my email
Then I receive a password reset email within 60 seconds

# ❌ Non-testable criterion
The password reset flow should work correctly
```

## Story Sizing Rules

| Size           | Fits in a single sprint? | Implementation clarity           |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| XS (0.5-1 day) | Yes                      | Fully clear, no unknowns         |
| S (1-2 days)   | Yes                      | Clear, minor edge cases          |
| M (3-5 days)   | Yes (one sprint)         | Mostly clear, some UX decisions  |
| L (1+ weeks)   | No → **Split it**        | Still has ambiguity → split      |
| XL             | Never                    | Must be decomposed before taking |

**Rule:** If a story contains the word "and" in its user story clause, it's two stories.

## Backlog Item Types

```
Epic     → Multi-sprint capability (e.g., "Authentication System")
Story    → Single deliverable within a sprint (e.g., "Social Login via Google")
Task     → Engineering sub-task within a story (e.g., "Set up Google OAuth client")
Bug      → Deviation from defined acceptance criteria
Spike    → Research task with a timebox, not a deliverable
```

---

## Definition of Done

Every item is "done" only when:

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified manually or by automated test
- [ ] No new lint/type errors introduced
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated
- [ ] QA signed off (or automated test added)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and passing
