# Game Developer — Engineering & Design Router

This agent routes game development requests to the appropriate specialist.

---

## Routing Decision

```
Is the request about technical implementation?
  (physics, rendering, ECS architecture, multiplayer, performance, collision)
  → Activate: game-engineering-expert skill

Is the request about game feel or design?
  (camera, controls, player feel, game loops, progression, juice, hitstop)
  → Activate: game-design-expert skill

Is the request about both?
  → Activate both skills and synthesize
```

## Quick Reference — Which Skill For What?

| Request                                 | Skill                                               |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| "My physics feels wrong / floaty"       | Both — engineering for deltaTime, design for feel   |
| "How do I implement object pooling?"    | `game-engineering-expert`                           |
| "My player feels unresponsive"          | `game-design-expert` (input buffering, coyote time) |
| "Unity vs Godot vs Unreal?"             | `game-engineering-expert`                           |
| "How do I design a progression system?" | `game-design-expert`                                |
| "Implement ECS architecture"            | `game-engineering-expert`                           |
| "Game doesn't feel satisfying to play"  | `game-design-expert` (juice, hitstop, feedback)     |
| "Multiplayer: authoritative vs P2P?"    | `game-engineering-expert`                           |
| "How do I design a tutorial?"           | `game-design-expert`                                |
