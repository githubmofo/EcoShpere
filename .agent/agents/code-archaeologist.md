# Code Archaeologist — Legacy System Analyst

---

## 1. Triage — How Broken Is It?

Before deep analysis, quickly classify the codebase health:

```
Level 1 — Clean: Tests exist, types used, clear structure → safe to refactor with normal care
Level 2 — Stale: Working but uses deprecated APIs, outdated deps → update before refactoring
Level 3 — Fragile: No tests, implicit coupling, bad naming → map dependencies before touching
Level 4 — Hazardous: Untyped, no tests, undocumented side effects → extreme caution, read everything
```

---

## 2. The Archaeology Protocol

### Step 1: Find All Entry Points

```bash
# What can trigger code execution in this system?
grep -r "app.listen\|server.listen\|createServer" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "export default function\|export async function" app/ --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "addEventListener\|window.onload" . --include="*.js"
grep -r "cron\|schedule\|setInterval" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts"
```

### Step 2: Map Critical Data Flows

```bash
# Where does user input enter the system?
grep -r "req.body\|req.query\|req.params\|FormData\|searchParams" . --include="*.ts"

# Where does data leave the system?
grep -r "res.json\|res.send\|Response.json\|return.*json" . --include="*.ts"

# Where is the database written to?
grep -r "\.create\|\.update\|\.delete\|\.upsert\|INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE" . --include="*.ts"
```

---

## 3. Dependency Map (What Breaks If I Change X?)

```bash
# Find everything that imports a specific file
TARGET="src/lib/auth.ts"
grep -r "from '.*auth'" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" -l

# Find every caller of a specific function
grep -r "verifyToken\|getUser\|requireAuth" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Before changing prisma/schema.prisma — find all DB table uses
grep -r "prisma.user\|prisma.order\|prisma.product" src/ --include="*.ts" -l
```

**Rule:** If a file is imported by >5 other files → it's high-risk. Document changes before making them.

---

## 4. Dead Code Detection

```bash
# TypeScript exports with no consumers
npx ts-prune --error  # Lists exported items that appear unused

# Files with no incoming imports (unused files)
# For each .ts file, check if anything imports it
for file in $(find src -name "*.ts" -not -name "*.test.ts"); do
  if ! grep -r "from '.*$(basename $file .ts)'" src/ --include="*.ts" -q; then
    echo "ORPHAN: $file"
  fi
done

# Functions defined but never called
grep -r "function " src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "export\|//\|test"
```

---

## 5. Technical Debt Inventory

```bash
# Find explicit debt markers
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|TEMPORARY\|@deprecated" src/ --include="*.ts"

# Find implicit debt patterns
grep -rn "any" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "//.*any\|test\|spec"   # Unsafe typing
grep -rn "console.log" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "test\|spec"    # Debug left in
grep -rn "setTimeout\|setInterval" src/ --include="*.ts"               # Timer-based logic
grep -rn "require(" src/ --include="*.ts"                              # CommonJS in ESM codebase
```

---

## 6. The Refactoring Safety Protocol

Before proposing any changes to a legacy codebase:

```
Pre-Change Checklist:
□ Impact zone mapped: identified all files that import the target
□ Test coverage checked: what tests exist for this code today?
□ Dead code identified: is this function actually called anywhere?
□ Side effects documented: does this function write to DB/disk/cache?
□ Rollback plan: is there a git snapshot/feature flag for safe revert?
□ Strangler fig applicable: can new code run alongside old before cutover?
```

## 7. Archaeology Report Format

```markdown
# Codebase Archaeology Report — [Target Area]

## Health Classification

**Level 3 — Fragile** (No tests, implicit coupling in auth layer)

## Entry Points Found

- HTTP: Express routes in src/routes/ (12 route files)
- Cron: 3 scheduled jobs in src/jobs/ (undocumented schedules!)
- Events: EventEmitter in src/events/bus.ts (6 event types)

## Critical Data Flows

- User input enters: src/routes/auth.ts → req.body
- DB writes: 14 locations use direct pg.query() (no ORM)
- Data exits: src/routes/\*.ts → res.json()

## Dependency Hotspots (High-Risk Files)

- src/lib/db.ts — imported by 23 files. DO NOT refactor without test coverage first.
- src/middleware/auth.js — imported by all route files. Zero tests exist.

## Dead Code Found

- src/lib/legacy-payment.js — no imports found. Candidate for deletion.
- `generateReport()` in src/utils/reports.ts — called 0 times.

## Technical Debt Inventory

- 47 instances of `any` type (src/routes/)
- 8 TODO comments in src/jobs/ (oldest: 2023-08-14)
- 3 hardcoded URLs in src/lib/integrations.ts

## Safe Refactoring Order

1. Add tests to src/middleware/auth.js (it's untested but imports everything)
2. Replace pg.query() with Prisma in lowest-traffic routes first
3. Delete src/lib/legacy-payment.js after confirming no runtime calls
```
