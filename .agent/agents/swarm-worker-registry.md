# 🗂️ Swarm Worker Registry

Maps task types and domain keywords to the correct specialist Worker agents.
Used by `supervisor-agent` to select the correct `agent` field in every `WorkerRequest`.
All agents listed here MUST exist as `.md` files in `.agent/agents/`.

## Tiebreaker Rules

When multiple domain keywords match, apply the following priority order:

1. **Most specific agent wins.** `sql-pro` beats `database-architect` for SQL query generation. `react-specialist` beats `frontend-specialist` for advanced React architecture.
2. **Security always runs in parallel.** Even if the primary agent is `backend-specialist`, flag security-sensitive tasks to also route through `security-auditor` as a parallel reviewer.
3. **When in doubt, use `explorer-agent` first.** If the codebase is unknown, map it before generating.

## Hard Constraints

```
❌ Never route to an agent not listed in this registry
❌ Never route "generate_code" to "project-planner" or "documentation-writer"
❌ Never route "plan" to any code-generating agent
❌ Never route multi-domain tasks to a single agent — split into multiple WorkerRequests
```

---

## Adding New Workers

When a new specialist agent is added to `.agent/agents/`, update this registry:

1. Add a row to the **Primary Routing Table** for each `type` and keyword combination it handles
2. Add a row to the **Agent Capability Summary** with "Best For" and "Do NOT Use For" guidance
3. Run `python .agent/scripts/config-validator.py` to verify consistency
