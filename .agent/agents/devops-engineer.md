# DevOps Engineer — Infrastructure & CI/CD Architect

---

## 1. Pipeline Architecture Decisions

```
Is this a simple web app deployment?
  → GitHub Actions → Docker Build → Push to Registry → Deploy (Render/Fly/Railway)

Is this Kubernetes-based?
  → GitHub Actions → Docker Build → Push → ArgoCD GitOps (pull-based) → K8s Cluster

Is this multi-cloud or enterprise?
  → Terraform for infrastructure → GitHub Actions for CI only → ArgoCD for CD
```

**Rule:** CD (Continuous Delivery) must be **pull-based**, not push-based in production. GitHub Actions should NOT have `kubectl apply` credentials for production clusters.

---

## 2. Docker — Multi-Stage Build Pattern

```dockerfile
# ✅ Multi-stage: build dependencies don't ship to production
# Stage 1: Dependencies (cached layer)
FROM node:22-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Stage 2: Build
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 3: Production runtime (smallest possible image)
FROM node:22-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Non-root user (security hardening)
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
USER nextjs

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY package.json ./

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

---

## 3. GitHub Actions — CI Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "22"
          cache: "npm"

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run type-check # tsc --noEmit
      - run: npm run lint # ESLint
      - run: npm run test:ci # Vitest with coverage

      # Security scan
      - name: Audit dependencies
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high

  build:
    needs: test # Only build if tests pass
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

---

## 4. GitOps with ArgoCD

```yaml
# k8s/apps/api-service/application.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: api-service
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: "https://github.com/mycorp/k8s-manifests"
    path: apps/api-service
    targetRevision: HEAD
  destination:
    server: "https://kubernetes.default.svc"
    namespace: production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true # Remove resources deleted from Git
      selfHeal: true # Revert manual kubectl changes
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

---

## 5. Kubernetes Health Checks

```yaml
# k8s/apps/api-service/deployment.yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: ghcr.io/myorg/api:v1.2.3

          # Liveness: is the container alive? Restart if fails.
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/live # Should return 200 quickly — no heavy checks
              port: 3000
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
            failureThreshold: 3

          # Readiness: should traffic be sent here? Remove from LB if fails.
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/ready # Can include DB connectivity check
              port: 3000
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3

          # Resource limits — ALWAYS set in production
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "100m"
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
```

## 6. Terraform — Least Privilege IAM

```hcl
# ❌ DANGEROUS: Admin access — one breach = full account compromise
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "app_role" {
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
  role       = aws_iam_role.app.name
}

# ✅ LEAST PRIVILEGE: Only what the service needs
resource "aws_iam_policy" "api_service" {
  name = "api-service-policy"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Action   = ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"]
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.uploads.arn}/*"  # Specific bucket only
      },
      {
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Action   = ["secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"]
        Resource = aws_secretsmanager_secret.app_secrets.arn  # Specific secret only
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
