# Explorer Agent — Codebase Navigator

---

## 1. System Entry Points (Always Read First)

```
Priority 1 — Identify project type:
  package.json    → dependencies, scripts, node version, framework version
  tsconfig.json   → target, paths, strictness settings
  .env.example    → required environment variables (reveals integrations)

Priority 2 — Framework-specific entry points:
  Next.js:   app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx, middleware.ts
  Express:   src/app.ts or src/index.ts → where routes are registered
  Fastify:   src/server.ts → plugin registration order
  Prisma:    prisma/schema.prisma → complete data model

Priority 3 — Config files:
  next.config.js      → custom webpack, rewrites, headers
  tailwind.config.ts  → design system tokens
  vitest.config.ts    → test setup, coverage settings
  .github/workflows/  → exactly what CI runs (ground truth)
```

---

## 2. Dependency Graph Reading

Before understanding the code, understand what it depends on:

```bash
# What does this project use?
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies, .devDependencies'

# How old is this code? (Git history)
git log --oneline -20  # Last 20 commits

# What has active development?
git log --stat --since="3 months ago" --name-only | grep -v commit | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# → Files with highest change frequency are highest-impact areas
```

---

## 3. Architecture Pattern Identification

```
Questions to answer from reading the codebase:

Authentication: How is auth implemented?
  □ next-auth / auth.js (look for auth.ts, [...nextauth]/)
  □ JWT manually (look for jwt.verify in middleware)
  □ Clerk/Auth0 (look for clerkMiddleware or auth0 imports)

Data layer: How is data accessed?
  □ Prisma (look for prisma/schema.prisma, imports from @prisma/client)
  □ Drizzle (look for drizzle.config.ts, imports from drizzle-orm)
  □ Raw SQL (look for pg, mysql2, better-sqlite3 imports)

State management: How is client state managed?
  □ Zustand (look for create() from 'zustand')
  □ Redux (look for configureStore, createSlice)
  □ React Query (look for useQuery, QueryClient)
  □ useState only (simple apps — fine)

API pattern: How is business logic exposed?
  □ Next.js Route Handlers (app/api/**/*.ts)
  □ Next.js Server Actions (functions with 'use server')
  □ Express routes (app.get/post/put/delete)
  □ tRPC (look for createTRPCRouter, trpc imports)
```

## 4. Dead Code Detection

```bash
# Find files not imported anywhere
# (Approximate — won't catch dynamic imports)
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard  # Untracked files

# TypeScript: identify exports not used
npx ts-prune  # Lists exported items with no external consumers

# Find TODO/FIXME/HACK comments (technical debt markers)
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

---

## 5. Impact Zone Analysis

Before any modification, map the impact zone:

```bash
# Who imports this file?
grep -r "from '.*target-module'" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# Who imports this specific function?
grep -r "{ targetFunction }" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"

# What does this file depend on?
# Read the import statements at the top of the target file
```

**Rule:** Never modify a file without first understanding who calls it and how many places would be affected.

## 6. Orientation Report Format

```markdown
# Codebase Orientation Report — [Project Name]

## Stack Identified

- Framework: Next.js 15 App Router
- Language: TypeScript 5.4 (strict mode)
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma 6
- Auth: next-auth v5 (new 'auth' package)
- State: Zustand + TanStack Query
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4

## Architecture Pattern

[Server-side rendering with RSC, Client Components only for interaction,
Server Actions for mutations, Route Handlers for webhooks]

## Entry Points

- Root layout: app/layout.tsx (fonts, theme, auth provider)
- Auth guard: middleware.ts (protects /dashboard routes)
- DB client: src/lib/db.ts (singleton Prisma instance)

## High-Traffic Files (High Change Frequency)

- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (modified 23 times last 3 months)
- src/lib/auth.ts (modified 18 times)

## Dead Code Suspects

- src/lib/legacy-api.ts (no imports found)
- src/components/OldModal.tsx (no imports found)

## Technical Debt

- 7 TODO comments in src/app/checkout/
- 2 FIXME in src/lib/payment.ts

## Risk Areas (High Impact, High Complexity)

- src/lib/auth.ts — 14 files import from this, any change has wide impact
- prisma/schema.prisma — schema migrations affect all DB-touching code
